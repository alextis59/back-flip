# Core Functionality

## async-express/index.js

### asyncWrap

The `asyncWrap` function is a pivotal utility within the `async-express/index.js` module, designed to bridge the gap between asynchronous and synchronous middleware in Express applications. This function is critical for developers who wish to streamline their middleware execution flow, ensuring that any errors arising from asynchronous operations are appropriately managed and propagated through the middleware stack.

At its core, `asyncWrap` facilitates the seamless integration of asynchronous functions into an Express middleware chain. Traditional Express middleware functions are predominantly synchronous, but modern applications often require asynchronous operations, such as database queries or external API calls. Without proper handling, these asynchronous operations can disrupt the middleware flow, leading to uncaught errors and unpredictable behavior. `asyncWrap` addresses this challenge by encapsulating both synchronous and asynchronous middleware functions, ensuring consistent error handling and middleware execution.

The function accepts a variable number of middleware functions as parameters. It processes these functions sequentially, wrapping each one to catch any errors that may occur during their execution. If an error is encountered in an asynchronous middleware, `asyncWrap` captures it and forwards it to the next middleware or error handler, thereby maintaining the integrity of the middleware chain.

To illustrate the utility of `asyncWrap`, consider an Express application that needs to perform both synchronous and asynchronous operations. For instance, an asynchronous middleware might fetch data from a database, while a synchronous middleware might validate the fetched data. By using `asyncWrap`, developers can ensure that any errors in the asynchronous operation are caught and handled correctly, without disrupting the synchronous validation process.

Here is a practical example of how `asyncWrap` can be implemented in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const asyncWrap = require('./async-express/index.js').asyncWrap;

const app = express();

// Example asynchronous middleware
const asyncMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        await someAsyncOperation();
        next();
    } catch (error) {
        next(error);
    }
};

// Example synchronous middleware
const syncMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    // Perform some synchronous operations
    next();
};

// Use asyncWrap to handle both async and sync middlewares
app.use(asyncWrap(asyncMiddleware, syncMiddleware));

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

async function someAsyncOperation() {
    // Simulate a delay
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
}
```

In this example, `asyncWrap` is utilized to wrap both an asynchronous middleware (`asyncMiddleware`) and a synchronous middleware (`syncMiddleware`). The asynchronous middleware performs a simulated asynchronous operation, while the synchronous middleware executes immediately. If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, it is caught by `asyncWrap` and passed to the error handling middleware, which sends a response indicating that something went wrong.

The use of `asyncWrap` in this manner not only simplifies the middleware implementation but also enhances the robustness and maintainability of the code. Developers can write cleaner, more concise middleware functions without worrying about the intricacies of error handling in asynchronous operations. This utility is particularly beneficial in complex applications where multiple asynchronous operations are performed, as it ensures that all errors are consistently managed and propagated through the middleware stack.

In conclusion, `asyncWrap` is an essential utility for any Express application that incorporates asynchronous middleware. By providing a consistent mechanism for handling errors in both synchronous and asynchronous middleware functions, it allows developers to create more reliable and maintainable code. The function's ability to seamlessly integrate asynchronous operations into the middleware chain makes it a valuable tool for modern web development, ensuring that applications can handle errors gracefully and maintain a smooth execution flow.

### asyncRouter

The `asyncRouter` function in `async-express/index.js` serves as a powerful utility to streamline the handling of asynchronous routes within an Express application. This function extends the standard Express router with the capability to manage asynchronous route handlers seamlessly, ensuring that any errors encountered during asynchronous operations are properly caught and handled.

### Description

The primary goal of `asyncRouter` is to simplify the integration of asynchronous route handlers into an Express application. Traditional Express routers do not inherently support asynchronous route handlers, which can lead to unhandled promise rejections and other issues if errors occur during asynchronous operations. The `asyncRouter` function addresses this limitation by wrapping route handlers in a way that ensures any errors are caught and passed to the next middleware or error handler.

### Usage

The `asyncRouter` function can be used to create a router instance that supports asynchronous route handlers. It provides a familiar interface similar to the standard Express router, but with enhanced error handling capabilities for asynchronous operations.

### Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to use `asyncRouter` to define routes with asynchronous handlers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { asyncRouter } = require('./async-express/index.js');

const router = asyncRouter();

// Example asynchronous route handler for a GET request
router.get('/data', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const data = await fetchDataFromDatabase();
        res.json(data);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error);
    }
});

// Example asynchronous route handler for a POST request
router.post('/data', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const newData = await saveDataToDatabase(req.body);
        res.status(201).json(newData);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error);
    }
});

// Integrate the router into an Express application
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api', router);

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

async function fetchDataFromDatabase() {
    // Simulate a database fetch operation
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve({ key: 'value' }), 1000));
}

async function saveDataToDatabase(data) {
    // Simulate a database save operation
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve({ id: 1, ...data }), 1000));
}
```

In this example, `asyncRouter` is used to create a router instance that can handle asynchronous route handlers for both GET and POST requests. The asynchronous route handlers perform database operations, and any errors encountered during these operations are caught and passed to the error handling middleware.

By leveraging `asyncRouter`, developers can effortlessly integrate asynchronous route handlers into their Express applications, ensuring robust error handling and a cleaner, more maintainable codebase. This utility is particularly useful for modern web applications that rely heavily on asynchronous operations, such as database interactions, API calls, and other I/O-bound tasks.

## db/auto_publish.js

### onEntityCreate

The `onEntityCreate` function is an essential part of the `db/auto_publish.js` module, responsible for handling the creation of new entities within the database. This function ensures that each newly created entity is properly logged and tracked, facilitating seamless integration with other components of the system that depend on real-time data consistency and event-driven architecture.

When an entity is created, the `onEntityCreate` function is triggered, initiating a series of operations designed to manage and record this event accurately. The function first extracts the `entity_name` from the provided data, which identifies the type of entity being created. It then checks if the entity type is one that requires tracking by invoking the `isTrackedEntity` method. This step is crucial as it determines whether the creation event needs to be logged for future reference and auditing purposes.

If the entity type is indeed tracked, the function proceeds to gather a list of inserted entity IDs from the `data.result.insertedIds` array. This array contains the unique identifiers assigned to each entity by the database upon successful insertion. Additionally, the function retrieves the `creation_date` from the first entity in the `data.entities` array, defaulting to the current timestamp if no specific creation date is provided.

The `requestor_id` is another critical piece of information managed by `onEntityCreate`. It identifies the user or system that initiated the entity creation. This ID is derived from various sources within the data, including the `requestor_id` field, the target updater field specified in the options, or the default service name configured in the database settings.

With these details in hand, the function constructs a list of creation objects, each representing an entity creation event. These objects include the `entity_name`, `entity_id`, `requestor_id`, and `creation_date`. This list is then passed to the `createEntities` method, which inserts the creation objects into a dedicated collection within the database. The `no_creation_date` option is set to `true` to prevent the insertion of a new creation date, as it is already specified in the creation objects.

By meticulously logging each entity creation, the `onEntityCreate` function supports robust data tracking and auditing capabilities. This functionality is vital for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that all changes within the database are transparently recorded. This process also enables other system components to react to creation events in real-time, facilitating a dynamic and responsive application architecture.

In summary, the `onEntityCreate` function plays a pivotal role in the `db/auto_publish.js` module by managing the creation of new entities, ensuring they are accurately tracked, and recording essential details for auditing and real-time processing purposes. This functionality underscores the importance of meticulous event handling in maintaining a reliable and consistent database system.

### onEntityUpdate

The `onEntityUpdate` function is an integral part of the `db/auto_publish.js` module, playing a crucial role in managing database event subscriptions and publishing updates. This function is designed to handle the updates of entities within the database, ensuring that any changes made to an entity are appropriately processed and published to the relevant subscribers.

When an entity is updated, the `onEntityUpdate` function is invoked to manage the update process. It begins by verifying if the entity in question is tracked using the `isTrackedEntity` method. This check is essential to determine whether the entity's updates should be monitored and published. If the entity is tracked, the function proceeds to filter the update object. This filtering process involves retaining only the attributes specified in the whitelist and excluding those in the blacklist, ensuring that only the relevant data is processed.

The filtering is accomplished by the `filterTrackedEntityUpdate` function, which takes into account the entity's specific tracking options, including attribute whitelists and blacklists. These options help in refining the update object to include only the necessary attributes, thereby maintaining data integrity and relevance.

Once the update object is filtered, the function checks if there are any attributes left to be published. If the filtered update object contains valid attributes, the function constructs an update object that includes the entity name, entity ID, the filtered data, the requestor ID, and the update date. The requestor ID is determined from various sources, such as the data object, options, or the database service name, ensuring that the origin of the update is accurately recorded.

The constructed update object is then created in the database using the `createEntity` method. This method inserts the update object into the specified collection, with an option to bypass the creation date if necessary. By doing so, the function ensures that the update is recorded and can be retrieved or referenced in future operations.

In summary, the `onEntityUpdate` function is a critical component of the auto-publishing mechanism within the `db/auto_publish.js` module. It meticulously handles entity updates by verifying tracking status, filtering update attributes, constructing update objects, and recording these updates in the database. This process ensures that entity changes are accurately captured and disseminated to the appropriate subscribers, maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data across the system.

### onEntityDelete

The `onEntityDelete` function is a crucial part of the `db/auto_publish.js` module, responsible for handling the deletion events of entities within the database. This function is designed to ensure that any necessary actions are performed when an entity is deleted, such as publishing relevant information to subscribed clients and maintaining data integrity across the system.

Upon the deletion of an entity, the `onEntityDelete` function is triggered. This function first checks if the entity type is included in the configured whitelist or not present in the blacklist, ensuring that only the appropriate entities are processed. This filtering mechanism is essential for controlling which entities trigger the event, thereby preventing unnecessary operations on irrelevant data.

Once an entity is deemed eligible, the function proceeds to gather the necessary information about the entity. This includes fetching the entity's current state from the database, which is crucial for providing accurate and up-to-date information to any subscribed clients. The function then constructs a message containing the details of the deleted entity, formatted according to the predefined schema.

The next step involves publishing the constructed message to the relevant message queues or topics. This is typically done using a message broker such as NATS, which is configured to handle the inter-service communication within the project. By publishing the deletion event, the system ensures that all interested parties are notified of the change, allowing them to take appropriate actions, such as updating their local caches or triggering further business logic.

Additionally, the `onEntityDelete` function includes error handling mechanisms to manage any issues that may arise during the process. This ensures that any failures in publishing the message or fetching the entity data are logged and managed appropriately, preventing the system from entering an inconsistent state.

In summary, the `onEntityDelete` function is a vital component that manages the lifecycle of entity deletions within the `db/auto_publish.js` module. It ensures that deletions are processed correctly, relevant information is published to subscribers, and any errors are handled gracefully, maintaining the overall integrity and reliability of the system.

## db/cache.js

### onEventSubscribe

The `onEventSubscribe` function is an integral part of the `db/cache.js` module, serving as a mechanism to listen for specific database events. This function is designed to register event listeners for various database operations such as 'create', 'update', and 'delete'. By subscribing to these events, the system can perform additional actions or trigger workflows in response to changes in the database. 

When utilizing `onEventSubscribe`, a callback function is associated with a particular event name. This callback function will be executed whenever the specified event occurs. The function ensures that each event type can have multiple listeners, enabling a flexible and extensible event-handling architecture.

Here's a breakdown of how `onEventSubscribe` works:

1. **Event Registration**: The function first checks if the event name already has a list of associated listeners. If not, it initializes an empty array for that event. This ensures that multiple callbacks can be registered for the same event type without overwriting existing listeners.

2. **Callback Association**: Once the event's listener array is confirmed to exist, the provided callback function is added to this array. This allows the system to maintain a collection of functions that should be executed when the event is triggered.

3. **Event Handling**: When an event occurs, all associated callbacks in the listener array are executed in the order they were registered. This enables the execution of multiple operations in response to a single event, such as logging, data synchronization, or triggering other workflows.

The `onEventSubscribe` function is essential for creating a dynamic and responsive system that can adapt to changes in the database in real-time. By leveraging this function, developers can implement custom logic that responds to data modifications, ensuring that the application remains consistent and up-to-date with the latest database state.

Below is a simplified example of how `onEventSubscribe` might be implemented:

```javascript
/**
 * Subscribes a callback function to a specific database event.
 * @param {string} event_name - The name of the event to subscribe to (e.g., 'create', 'update', 'delete').
 * @param {function} cb - The callback function to execute when the event occurs.
 */
function onEventSubscribe(event_name, cb) {
    if (!self.event_listeners[event_name]) {
        self.event_listeners[event_name] = [];
    }
    self.event_listeners[event_name].push(cb);
}
```

In this example, the `event_name` parameter specifies the type of event to listen for, while the `cb` parameter is the callback function that will be executed when the event occurs. The `self.event_listeners` object maintains a list of listeners for each event type, ensuring that multiple callbacks can be registered and executed in sequence.

By incorporating `onEventSubscribe` into the `db/cache.js` module, the back-flip project ensures that it has a robust and flexible mechanism for handling database events, enabling developers to build responsive and dynamic applications.

## db/index.js

### initialize

The initialization function is a critical component of the database management system in the back-flip project. This function is responsible for setting up the database connection and configuring various parameters necessary for the smooth operation of database interactions. The initialization process ensures that the database is ready to handle incoming requests and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently.

The function begins by checking if the database has already been initialized to prevent redundant operations. If the database is not yet initialized, it proceeds with the initialization steps. The logger is utilized to provide debug information about the initialization process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and monitoring.

Several options can be configured during the initialization process:

1. **Database URI**: This parameter specifies the connection string used to connect to the MongoDB server. It allows the flexibility to connect to different database instances as required by the environment (e.g., development, testing, production).

2. **Database Name**: This parameter sets the name of the database to which the application will connect. It is essential for organizing data within specific databases, especially when multiple databases are managed by the same MongoDB server.

3. **Service Name**: The service name is used to identify the specific service or application instance that is connecting to the database. This can be useful for logging and monitoring purposes, providing a clear context of which service is performing database operations.

4. **Projection Fields**: This option allows the specification of additional fields that should be included in database projections. Projections are used to limit the amount of data returned by queries, improving performance by fetching only the necessary fields.

5. **Default Sort**: This parameter sets the default sorting order for query results. By defining a default sort order, the application can ensure consistent and predictable data retrieval, which can be particularly important for paginated results or ordered data displays.

The initialization function also handles setting up the database client and ensuring that the connection is established correctly. It leverages the `moment` library to obtain the current UTC date, which can be used for timestamping and other time-related operations throughout the application.

In summary, the initialization function is designed to configure and establish a robust connection to the MongoDB database, providing essential settings and ensuring that the database is prepared for efficient and reliable data operations. Its flexible configuration options and detailed logging make it a vital part of the back-flip project's database management system.

### connect

The `connect` function is a critical component within the `db/index.js` file, responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the MongoDB database. This function is designed to ensure that the application can reliably connect to the database, handle connection retries, and manage the state of the database connection efficiently.

The function accepts two parameters: a callback function (`cb`) and an options object (`options`). The callback function is invoked once the connection process is complete, either successfully or with an error. The options object allows for customization of the connection process, including settings for connection timeouts and other configurations.

Upon invocation, the `connect` function first checks if a connection is already in the process of being established by evaluating the `self.connecting_db` flag. If a connection attempt is already underway, the function enters a loop, periodically waiting (using `utils.wait(100)`) until the ongoing connection attempt is resolved.

If no connection attempt is in progress, the function sets the `self.connecting_db` flag to `true` to indicate that a connection attempt is now being made. It then proceeds to log the connection attempt using the `logger.debug` method, providing visibility into the connection process for debugging purposes.

The core of the connection process involves invoking the `MongoClient.connect` method from the MongoDB library, with the database URI (`self.db_uri`) and connection timeout settings. The connection timeout can be customized through the `options.connection_timeout` parameter, defaulting to 1000 milliseconds if not specified.

Once the connection is successfully established, the function assigns the resulting MongoDB client instance to `self.client` and the database instance to `self.db`. It also sets up an event listener on the MongoDB client to handle the 'close' event, logging an error message if the database connection is unexpectedly closed.

To ensure the database connection remains active and responsive, the function sends a ping command (`self.db.command({ ping: 1 })`) to the database. This step verifies the connection's health and responsiveness.

After successfully establishing the connection and verifying its health, the function invokes the callback function (`cb`) with the database instance (`self.db`) as an argument, signaling that the connection process is complete. It then returns the database instance (`self.db`) to the caller.

In case of any errors during the connection attempt, the function includes error handling mechanisms to log the error and reset the `self.connecting_db` flag, ensuring that subsequent connection attempts can be made.

Overall, the `connect` function is designed to provide a robust and reliable mechanism for establishing and managing the MongoDB database connection, with support for customization and error handling to ensure smooth operation of the application.

### disconnect

The `disconnect` function is a critical part of the database management module in the back-flip project. This function is responsible for gracefully closing the connection to the MongoDB database, ensuring that all resources are properly released and any necessary cleanup tasks are performed. Proper disconnection from the database is essential to maintain the stability and performance of the application, especially in environments where multiple connections are frequently opened and closed.

When invoked, the `disconnect` function performs a series of steps to ensure a safe and thorough disconnection process. It begins by checking if there is an active MongoDB client instance. If an active client is detected, the function proceeds to close the connection using the `close` method provided by the MongoDB client library. This method ensures that all ongoing operations are completed or terminated appropriately before closing the connection.

Throughout the disconnection process, the function logs significant events and errors using the `winston` logger configured in the project. Logging these events is crucial for monitoring and debugging purposes, as it provides insights into the state of the database connection and any issues that might arise during the disconnection process. For example, a successful disconnection is logged with an informational message, while any errors encountered during the process are logged with an error message, including details about the nature of the error.

In addition to closing the MongoDB client connection, the `disconnect` function also updates the internal state of the database management module. It sets the client instance to `null`, indicating that there is no active connection, and resets any flags or variables used to track the connection status. This ensures that subsequent attempts to connect to the database will not be affected by stale or incorrect state information.

The function also accepts a callback parameter, which is invoked once the disconnection process is complete. This callback mechanism allows other parts of the application to be notified when the database connection has been successfully closed, enabling them to perform any necessary follow-up actions. For instance, the application might need to release other resources or update its internal state based on the disconnection event.

In summary, the `disconnect` function is a well-structured and essential component of the back-flip project's database management module. It ensures that the MongoDB database connection is closed safely and efficiently, logging important events and errors, updating the internal state, and providing a callback mechanism for further actions. Proper implementation and usage of this function are critical for maintaining the stability and performance of the application, especially in scenarios with frequent database connection operations.

### getCollection

The `getCollection` function is a crucial utility for interacting with MongoDB collections within the back-flip project. This asynchronous function is designed to retrieve a reference to a specified collection in the MongoDB database, facilitating various database operations such as queries, updates, and deletions.

When invoked, the function first ensures that a connection to the MongoDB instance is established. This is done by calling the `connect` method, which handles the initialization and connection processes. If the connection is successful, the function proceeds to fetch the collection reference using the `db.collection` method, where `db` is the MongoDB database instance and `entity_name` is the name of the collection to be retrieved.

The function accepts two parameters: `entity_name` and an optional callback function `cb`. The `entity_name` parameter is a string that specifies the name of the collection to be accessed. The callback function is intended to handle the results of the collection retrieval process, providing an error-first callback pattern commonly used in Node.js.

Upon successful retrieval of the collection, the function executes the callback function with `null` as the first argument (indicating no error) and the collection reference as the second argument. If the collection retrieval fails at any point, an error object is created using the `DatabaseError` class, and the callback function is invoked with this error object as the first argument.

The `getCollection` function is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple database operations need to be performed on a specific collection. By providing a consistent and reliable way to access MongoDB collections, this function helps streamline database interactions and ensures that all necessary connections are properly managed.

Key points to note about the `getCollection` function:
- It ensures a connection to the MongoDB instance before attempting to retrieve the collection.
- It uses an error-first callback pattern to handle the results of the collection retrieval process.
- It creates a `DatabaseError` object to encapsulate any errors that occur during the retrieval process.
- It is designed to be asynchronous, allowing for non-blocking database operations.

Overall, the `getCollection` function is an essential component of the back-flip project's database management system, providing a robust and efficient mechanism for accessing MongoDB collections.

### onEventSubscribe

The `onEventSubscribe` function is a critical component within the `db/index.js` file, responsible for managing event subscriptions in the MongoDB database. This function allows the system to listen for specific database events such as 'create', 'update', and 'delete', and execute corresponding callback functions when these events occur. 

The function takes two parameters: `event_name` and `cb`. The `event_name` parameter specifies the type of event to subscribe to, while `cb` is the callback function that gets executed when the specified event is triggered. 

Internally, `onEventSubscribe` maintains an event listener registry, which is essentially a collection of event names mapped to their respective callback functions. When an event occurs, the function iterates through the list of registered callbacks for that event and invokes each one, passing along any relevant data.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how `onEventSubscribe` operates:

1. **Event Listener Initialization**: 
    - When the function is first called with a specific `event_name`, it checks if an array for that event already exists in the event listener registry.
    - If it doesn’t exist, the function initializes an empty array for that event. This array will hold all the callback functions that need to be executed when the event occurs.

2. **Adding Callback Functions**:
    - The provided callback function `cb` is then added to the array of callbacks for the specified event.
    - This allows multiple callbacks to be registered for the same event, enabling the system to perform various actions in response to a single event.

3. **Event Triggering**:
    - When an event occurs (e.g., an entity is created, updated, or deleted), the corresponding event handler function is invoked.
    - The event handler function retrieves the array of callbacks for the event from the registry and iterates through it, executing each callback function in the order they were registered.

4. **Data Handling**:
    - The callback functions are executed with the event data as their argument. This data typically includes details about the database operation that triggered the event.
    - This mechanism ensures that all registered callbacks receive the necessary context to perform their tasks.

5. **Use Cases**:
    - Common use cases for `onEventSubscribe` include logging changes to the database, updating cache entries, notifying other system components of changes, and triggering additional business logic.

By providing a flexible and efficient way to handle database events, `onEventSubscribe` plays a pivotal role in the `back-flip` project’s architecture. It ensures that the system can react dynamically to changes in the database, thereby maintaining data integrity and enabling real-time processing of data-driven events.

### onEventUnsubscribe

The function, designed for unsubscribing from database events, plays a crucial role in managing event listeners dynamically. When working with database-driven applications, it's often necessary to subscribe to events such as create, update, and delete to perform various operations like logging, caching, or triggering additional workflows. However, there are scenarios where you need to remove these subscriptions to prevent memory leaks, avoid redundant operations, or simply because the listener is no longer required.

This function accepts two parameters: the name of the event and the callback function that was originally subscribed to the event. The event name is a string that identifies the specific event you want to unsubscribe from, such as 'create', 'update', or 'delete'. The callback function is the one that was previously registered to handle the event.

The function begins by checking if there are any listeners currently registered for the specified event. This is done by looking up the event name in the `event_listeners` object, which is a dictionary where keys are event names and values are arrays of callback functions. If the event name is found, the function proceeds to filter out the specified callback function from the array of listeners. This is achieved using the `_.filter` method from the `lodash` library, which creates a new array excluding the specified callback.

By removing the callback function from the list of listeners, the function effectively unsubscribes it from the event. This means that the callback will no longer be invoked when the event occurs. This mechanism is essential for maintaining the performance and stability of the application, especially in long-running processes where event subscriptions might change dynamically.

In summary, this function provides a robust way to manage event subscriptions by allowing you to dynamically remove listeners when they are no longer needed. This not only helps in optimizing resource usage but also ensures that the application behaves as expected by preventing unintended side effects from stale or redundant event handlers.

### onEvent

The `onEvent` function is a crucial part of the `db/index.js` file, responsible for handling and processing database events. This function acts as a centralized event dispatcher, ensuring that registered callbacks are invoked whenever specific events occur within the database. The function takes two parameters: `event_name`, a string representing the name of the event, and `data`, an object containing the event data to be processed.

When an event is triggered, the `onEvent` function checks if there are any listeners subscribed to the specified event name. If listeners are found, the function iterates through the list of callbacks and executes each one, passing the event data as an argument. This mechanism allows for flexible and modular handling of database events, enabling various parts of the application to respond to changes in the database state.

The implementation of the `onEvent` function ensures that event handling is both efficient and reliable. By maintaining a registry of event listeners, the function can quickly determine which callbacks need to be executed for a given event. This approach minimizes the overhead associated with event processing and ensures that all relevant parts of the application are notified of database changes in a timely manner.

In addition to its core functionality, the `onEvent` function plays a vital role in the broader event-driven architecture of the back-flip project. By facilitating communication between different components of the application, the function helps to maintain a cohesive and responsive system. This is particularly important in scenarios where multiple parts of the application need to react to the same event, such as updating the user interface, logging changes, or triggering additional workflows.

Overall, the `onEvent` function is a key component of the back-flip project's database management system, providing a robust and scalable solution for handling database events. Its design ensures that the application can efficiently process and respond to changes in the database, supporting a wide range of use cases and enabling seamless integration with other parts of the system.

### createEntity

The `createEntity` function plays a crucial role in the back-flip project by facilitating the creation of a single entity object within a specified collection. This function is designed to handle the insertion of new entity data into the MongoDB database, ensuring that each entity is appropriately structured and stored.

When invoked, the function requires several parameters: the `entity_name`, which specifies the collection where the entity will be stored; the `obj`, representing the entity object to be created; and an optional callback function (`cb`) along with additional options (`options`) that can modify the behavior of the creation process.

Upon execution, the function initiates by logging the creation attempt, capturing the `entity_name` for debugging and traceability purposes. It then delegates the actual creation process to the `createEntities` method, passing along the entity object encapsulated within an array. This delegation allows for consistent handling of both single and multiple entity creation scenarios, leveraging the same underlying logic and ensuring uniformity in how entities are processed and stored.

Key steps in the creation process include:
1. **Timestamp Assignment**: If the `no_creation_date` option is not set, the function assigns a `creation_date` timestamp to the entity, marking the exact time of its creation. This timestamp is crucial for maintaining accurate records of when entities are added to the database.
2. **Database Insertion**: The function then inserts the entity into the specified collection using MongoDB's `insertMany` method. This step ensures that the entity is persistently stored within the database.
3. **ID Assignment**: Post insertion, the function maps the inserted IDs from the database to the corresponding entities, ensuring that each entity object is updated with its unique identifier.
4. **Event Emission**: The function emits a "create" event, signaling other parts of the system about the new entity's creation. This event includes details such as the `entity_name`, the entities themselves, the result of the insertion, and any options that were applied. Emitting this event allows for subsequent actions, such as caching or publishing updates, to be triggered automatically.

Error handling is an integral part of the function, ensuring that any issues encountered during the creation process are captured and appropriately managed. If an error occurs, it is wrapped within a `DatabaseError` object, providing a consistent error reporting mechanism that can be leveraged for debugging and user notifications.

Overall, the `createEntity` function is a foundational component of the back-flip project's database management system, enabling seamless and efficient creation of new entity records while ensuring consistency, traceability, and error resilience throughout the process.

### createEntities

The `createEntities` function is a crucial method within the `db/index.js` file, designed to handle the batch creation of entity objects within a specified collection. This function is highly efficient for scenarios where multiple entities need to be inserted into the database simultaneously, as it minimizes the overhead associated with individual insert operations.

When invoking `createEntities`, the function requires several parameters: the name of the entity collection, a list of entity objects to be created, an optional callback function, and additional options for customization. The entity objects are expected to be in JSON format, each representing a distinct record to be added to the collection.

The process begins by logging the initiation of the entity creation operation, capturing essential input details such as the entity name and the list of entities. This logging is facilitated by the `logger.debug` method, which ensures that the operation's parameters are recorded for debugging and auditing purposes.

If the `no_creation_date` option is not specified or set to false, the function automatically assigns a creation date to each entity object. This timestamp is generated using the `getNow` utility function, ensuring that all entities have a consistent and accurate creation date, which is crucial for tracking and historical purposes.

Once the entities are prepared, the function proceeds to insert them into the specified collection using the `insertMany` method. This MongoDB operation is optimized for batch inserts, significantly improving performance compared to individual insert operations. Upon successful insertion, the function updates each entity object with its corresponding `_id` from the `result.insertedIds` array, ensuring that each entity is uniquely identifiable within the collection.

After the entities are inserted, the function triggers an event to notify other parts of the system about the creation of these new entities. This is achieved through the `onEvent` method, which broadcasts the "create" event along with relevant details such as the entity name, the list of created entities, the insertion result, and any additional options. This event-driven approach facilitates real-time updates and synchronization across different components of the application.

In case of an error during the insertion process, the function handles it gracefully by logging the error and wrapping it in a `DatabaseError` object. This ensures that any issues are promptly identified and reported, allowing for effective troubleshooting and resolution.

Overall, the `createEntities` function is a robust and efficient method for batch entity creation, providing essential features such as automatic timestamping, event broadcasting, and comprehensive error handling. Its design aligns with the project's goal of maintaining high performance and reliability in database operations.

### saveEntity

The `saveEntity` function is a critical component designed to persist an entity object into the specified collection within the MongoDB database. This function ensures that the entity is saved with its full object representation, including updates to its metadata such as the last modification date. It is essential for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the stored data.

When invoking this function, it requires three primary parameters: the name of the entity, the entity object itself, and an optional callback function. The entity object is expected to be a well-defined JSON object that adheres to the schema requirements of the collection it is being saved into.

Upon execution, the function begins by logging the operation using the `logger.debug` method to provide visibility into the inputs being processed. This logging step is crucial for debugging and tracking purposes, especially in a production environment where monitoring database operations is vital.

The entity object is then cloned to create a deep copy, ensuring that any modifications made during the save process do not affect the original object passed to the function. This cloned object is subsequently updated with a `last_modified` timestamp, which is generated using the `getNow` utility function. This timestamp is critical for tracking when the entity was last altered, providing a chronological reference for future operations and audits.

Next, the function performs the actual database operation by calling `collection.replaceOne`. This method attempts to find an existing document in the collection that matches the entity's unique identifier (`_id`). If a matching document is found, it is replaced with the new entity object. If no matching document is found, the operation fails, and an error is thrown.

The `replaceOne` method returns a result object, which includes information about the operation's outcome. This result is logged for further analysis and debugging. In case of an error during the database operation, a `DatabaseError` is instantiated with relevant details, and the error is thrown to be handled by the calling function or middleware.

Additionally, the function triggers an event by invoking `self.onEvent` with the event type "create," along with the entity name, the updated entity object, the result of the database operation, and any options provided. This event handling mechanism is part of a broader event-driven architecture that allows other components within the system to react to changes in the database, such as updating caches, publishing messages, or triggering additional workflows.

The optional callback function, if provided, is called with the error (if any) and the result of the operation. This allows for asynchronous handling of the save operation's outcome, enabling the calling code to respond appropriately based on whether the operation succeeded or failed.

In summary, the `saveEntity` function is a robust and comprehensive utility for persisting entity objects in a MongoDB collection. It ensures data integrity through cloning and timestamping, provides extensive logging for transparency, and integrates seamlessly with the system's event-driven architecture to notify other components of changes. This function is a cornerstone of the database management capabilities within the back-flip project, facilitating reliable and consistent data storage.

It ensures that the deletion process is handled with care, maintaining the integrity of the database and supporting the broader functionality of the back-flip project.

### findEntityFromQuery

The `findEntityFromQuery` function is a crucial utility designed to retrieve a single entity from the database based on a specified query. This function is highly flexible, allowing users to fine-tune their searches by including or excluding specific attributes through the `only` and `without` options. Additionally, it supports property path queries, enabling users to target nested properties within the entity.

When invoking this function, users must provide the `entity_name`, which identifies the collection to search within, and the `query`, an object that defines the criteria for locating the desired entity. The function also accepts a callback (`cb`) and an options object (`options`) to further customize the search behavior.

The options object can contain two arrays: `only` and `without`. The `only` array specifies which attributes should be included in the results, while the `without` array indicates which attributes should be excluded. This granularity ensures that users retrieve precisely the data they need, avoiding unnecessary overhead.

Upon execution, the function logs the query parameters for debugging purposes using the `logger.debug` method. It then constructs a projection object based on the provided options, which MongoDB uses to determine which fields to return in the result set. The function performs the query using the `findOne` method on the specified collection, applying the constructed projection.

If the query is successful, the function invokes the callback with the retrieved entity. In case of an error, it creates a new `DatabaseError` object, encapsulating the error details and the context of the `findEntityFromQuery` operation.

This determination is essential for various operations, including auditing, monitoring, and logging of entity changes. The function operates by checking the `entity_tracking` configuration, which holds the tracking status of different entities within the application.

When an entity is created, updated, or deleted, the system needs to know if these actions should be logged or monitored. The `isTrackedEntity` function facilitates this by verifying if the given entity is marked for tracking. It takes the entity's name as an input parameter and returns a boolean value—`true` if the entity is tracked and `false` otherwise.

Internally, the function accesses the `entity_tracking` object, which is a part of the tracking module's configuration. This object contains entries for each entity, specifying whether tracking is enabled (`tracking: true`) or disabled (`tracking: false`). The function checks the presence and status of the entity within this configuration.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how `isTrackedEntity` works:

1. **Input Parameter**: The function accepts a single parameter, `entity_name`, which is the name of the entity to be checked.
2. **Configuration Access**: It accesses the `entity_tracking` object to retrieve the tracking configuration for the specified entity.
3. **Tracking Status Check**: The function then checks if the entity exists in the `entity_tracking` object and if the `tracking` property is set to `true`.
4. **Return Value**: Based on the check, it returns `true` if the entity is tracked and `false` otherwise.

The `isTrackedEntity` function is often used in conjunction with other tracking-related functions within the `db/tracking.js` file. For example, before logging an update or deletion operation, the system will call `isTrackedEntity` to ensure that the entity involved in the operation is indeed tracked. This prevents unnecessary logging and ensures that only relevant data changes are recorded.

In summary, the `isTrackedEntity` function is a simple yet vital component of the back-flip project's tracking system. It ensures that the system accurately identifies which entities need to be monitored, thereby supporting the project's auditing and logging requirements.

This function is designed to handle the filtering and processing of entity update objects based on predefined tracking configurations. It ensures that only the attributes specified for tracking are retained and, if necessary, obfuscates certain attributes to maintain data privacy and integrity.

When an entity update event occurs, the `filterTrackedEntityUpdate` function is invoked to refine the update data. This involves several steps, starting with the retrieval of tracking options for the specified entity. These options include attribute whitelists and blacklists. The whitelist contains attributes that are explicitly allowed to be tracked, whereas the blacklist encompasses attributes that should be excluded from tracking.

The function first checks if the whitelist is populated. If so, it iterates over the attributes in the whitelist, preserving only those present in the update data. This ensures that only the explicitly permitted attributes are retained. If the whitelist is empty, the function then considers the blacklist. It filters out any attributes from the update data that are present in the blacklist, thereby excluding them from the tracking process.

In scenarios where obfuscation is required, the function applies the necessary transformations to the attributes, ensuring sensitive information is adequately protected. This is particularly important for maintaining compliance with data protection regulations and ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.

The result of the `filterTrackedEntityUpdate` function is a refined update object that includes only the attributes that are allowed to be tracked, with sensitive attributes obfuscated as needed. This filtered update object is then used in subsequent database operations, ensuring that only relevant and permitted data changes are recorded and processed.

By meticulously filtering and obfuscating entity updates, the `filterTrackedEntityUpdate` function plays a vital role in the back-flip project's data tracking and privacy management strategy. It provides a robust mechanism for controlling which attributes are tracked and how they are handled, thereby enhancing the overall security and integrity of the system's data management processes.

### getObfuscatedObject

The `getObfuscatedObject` function is an essential utility within the `db/tracking.js` module, designed to enhance data privacy and security by obfuscating specific attributes of an entity. This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that sensitive information is protected, particularly when entities are being tracked and logged within the database.

When invoked, the `getObfuscatedObject` function takes two parameters: `entity_name` and `data`. The `entity_name` parameter is a string that identifies the type of entity being processed, while the `data` parameter is an object containing the entity's attributes.

The function begins by retrieving the tracking configuration for the specified entity. This configuration is stored in the `entity_tracking` object and includes various settings such as attribute obfuscation rules. If no specific tracking configuration exists for the entity, the function defaults to an empty configuration.

Next, the function creates a deep clone of the `data` object to ensure that the original entity data remains unaltered. This cloned object, referred to as `obfuscated`, will be modified to obfuscate the necessary attributes.

The core of the obfuscation process involves iterating over the attributes of the cloned object. For each attribute, the function checks whether it is included in the `attr_obfuscation` array, which specifies the attributes that need to be obfuscated. If an attribute is listed in this array and its value is not null, the function replaces the attribute's value with an asterisk (`*`), effectively obfuscating it.

By obfuscating sensitive attributes, the function ensures that any potentially sensitive information is masked, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or exposure. This is particularly important in scenarios where entity data might be logged or transmitted for auditing or monitoring purposes.

The `getObfuscatedObject` function is designed to be flexible and configurable. The obfuscation rules can be tailored for each entity type, allowing for granular control over which attributes are obfuscated.

### getEntityDeleteObj

The `getEntityDeleteObj` function plays a crucial role in the back-flip project's database tracking system, particularly in the context of entity deletion. This function is designed to create a structured object that encapsulates all the necessary information about an entity that is slated for deletion. This object includes the obfuscated entity data, ensuring that sensitive attributes are masked before the entity is backed up in the database.

When an entity is marked for deletion, it is essential to maintain a record of this action for auditing, tracking, and potential recovery purposes. The `getEntityDeleteObj` function facilitates this by generating a comprehensive delete object that includes the entity's name, its unique identifier, the obfuscated data, the requestor's ID, and the deletion date.

The process begins with obfuscating certain attributes of the entity data. This is achieved through the `getObfuscatedObject` method, which takes the entity's name and data as inputs. The method checks for any attributes that need to be obfuscated based on predefined tracking options. If any attributes are marked for obfuscation, they are replaced with an asterisk (*) to mask their values. This step ensures that sensitive information is not exposed or stored in an unprotected manner.

Once the entity data is obfuscated, the `getEntityDeleteObj` function constructs the delete object. This object includes the following key components:

1. **Entity Name**: The name of the entity being deleted.
2. **Entity ID**: The unique identifier of the entity, converted to a string format.
3. **Data**: The obfuscated entity data, ensuring that any sensitive attributes are masked.
4. **Requestor ID**: The identifier of the individual or system that initiated the deletion request. This is crucial for auditing and tracking purposes.
5. **Deletion Date**: The timestamp indicating when the deletion request was made. This is obtained using the `getNow` method from the database utility, ensuring a precise and consistent timestamp format.

By encapsulating all this information, the delete object provides a comprehensive record of the deletion event. This record is then stored in a designated collection within the database, typically used for tracking deletions. This backup mechanism ensures that even if an entity is deleted, a record of its existence and the context of its deletion is preserved.

In summary, the `getEntityDeleteObj` function is an integral part of the back-flip project's database tracking system. It ensures that entities marked for deletion are properly documented, with sensitive information obfuscated, and all relevant details captured in a structured format. This functionality not only supports robust auditing and tracking but also enhances the overall data integrity and security of the system.

### beforeEntityDelete

The `beforeEntityDelete` function is a crucial part of the database tracking system within the back-flip project. It is designed to ensure that any entity scheduled for deletion is properly backed up before the actual deletion process occurs. This function is particularly important for maintaining data integrity and providing a mechanism for data recovery if necessary.

When an entity is marked for deletion, the `beforeEntityDelete` function first checks if the entity type is tracked. This is determined by the `isTrackedEntity` method, which verifies whether the entity in question should have its deletion process monitored and recorded. If the entity is indeed tracked, the function proceeds to fetch the entity from the database using the provided query. This query is typically an object that specifies the criteria for locating the entity within the database.

Once the entity is retrieved, the function constructs a delete object that encapsulates all necessary information about the entity. This delete object includes the entity's name, unique identifier, data, the identifier of the requestor who initiated the deletion, and the deletion date. The requestor ID is derived from the options provided to the function, defaulting to the service name if no specific requestor ID is supplied. This ensures that there is a clear record of who requested the deletion, which can be crucial for auditing and accountability purposes.

After constructing the delete object, the function saves this backup in a dedicated collection within the database. The backup process involves creating a new entry in the delete collection, which is specifically designed to store records of deleted entities. The `createEntity` method is used for this purpose, and it is called with the delete object and an option to exclude the creation date from the backup record. This exclusion is often necessary to maintain the integrity of the original deletion timestamp.

By performing these steps, the `beforeEntityDelete` function provides a robust mechanism for tracking deletions and ensuring that there is always a backup available for entities that are removed from the database. This not only helps in maintaining data integrity but also provides a safety net for recovering deleted data if needed. The function's design reflects best practices in data management and underscores the importance of meticulous record-keeping in database operations.

### beforeEntitiesDelete

The `beforeEntitiesDelete` function is a crucial part of the `db/tracking.js` module within the back-flip project. This function is designed to handle the pre-deletion process for multiple entities in the database. Its primary purpose is to ensure that a backup of the entities scheduled for deletion is saved, provided that they are tracked entities. This process involves creating a backup with certain attributes obfuscated if necessary, thus preserving critical information while adhering to privacy and data protection standards.

The function accepts three parameters: `entity_name`, `query`, and `options`. The `entity_name` parameter specifies the type of entity being processed, while the `query` parameter is used to locate the entities that need to be deleted. The `options` parameter allows for additional configurations, such as specifying the `requestor_id` or other relevant fields.

The function begins by checking if the provided entity type is tracked using the `isTrackedEntity` method. If the entity type is not tracked, the function exits early, as no further action is required. For tracked entities, the function proceeds to find all entities matching the given query using the `findEntitiesFromQuery` method. This method returns a list of entities that meet the criteria specified in the query.

Once the entities are retrieved, the function generates a `requestor_id`. This identifier is crucial for tracking who initiated the deletion request. The `requestor_id` can be provided directly in the `options` parameter, derived from the `target_updator_field` in the options, or default to the service name of the database.

The next step involves creating a list of delete objects for each entity. This is achieved by mapping over the retrieved entities and calling the `getEntityDeleteObj` method for each one. The `getEntityDeleteObj` method constructs a delete object containing essential information about the entity, including its ID, the data to be deleted, the `requestor_id`, and the deletion date. This delete object serves as a backup record in the database.

After generating the list of delete objects, the function saves these objects to a designated collection in the database. This is done using the `createEntities` method, which inserts the delete objects into the specified collection. The `no_creation_date` option is set to true to prevent the creation date from being added to the backup records, as the focus is on preserving the deletion date.

The `beforeEntitiesDelete` function ensures that all tracked entities scheduled for deletion are backed up appropriately, with sensitive attributes obfuscated as needed. This process maintains data integrity and accountability, providing a reliable way to restore entities if required. By implementing this function, the back-flip project ensures robust data management practices, enhancing the reliability and security of the application.

This function allows dynamic configuration of the logging system, ensuring that log messages are formatted and recorded according to the specified settings. The flexibility provided by this function is essential for maintaining a coherent and easily navigable log system, which is pivotal for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.

When invoked, `setConfig` accepts a configuration object that defines various parameters for the logger. These parameters can include log levels, log file paths, formats, and transports. The function is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the logging behavior to meet the needs of different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

One of the key features of the `setConfig` function is its support for custom log formats. By leveraging `winston`'s formatting capabilities, developers can define how log messages should be structured. This includes adding timestamps, correlation IDs, and other contextual information that can aid in tracing and diagnosing issues. The correlation ID, in particular, is a valuable addition as it allows for tracking individual requests and their associated log entries across different parts of the system.

Additionally, `setConfig` supports multiple transports, which means that log messages can be directed to various destinations simultaneously. Common transports include console output, file storage, and remote logging services. This multi-transport capability ensures that logs are accessible in different formats and locations, enhancing the robustness of the logging system.

To use the `setConfig` function, developers need to import it from the `log/index.js` file and call it with the desired configuration object. For example:

```javascript
const { setConfig } = require('./log');
const winston = require('winston');

setConfig({
    level: 'debug',
    format: winston.format.combine(
        winston.format.timestamp(),
        winston.format.printf(({ timestamp, level, message, correlationId }) => {
            return `${timestamp} [${level}] ${correlationId ? `[${correlationId}]` : ''} ${message}`;
        })
    ),
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.Console(),
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
    ]
});
```

In this example, the configuration object specifies a log level of 'debug', combines timestamp and custom printf formats, and sets up two transports: console and file. This setup ensures that all debug-level and above messages are logged to both the console and a file named `app.log`.

The `setConfig` function also allows for dynamic updates to the logging configuration at runtime. This means that the logging behavior can be adjusted without restarting the application, which is particularly useful in production environments where minimizing downtime is critical.

Overall, the `setConfig` function in `log/index.js` is a powerful tool for managing the logging system in the back-flip project. Its flexibility and support for custom formats and multiple transports make it an essential component for effective logging and monitoring.

## middlewares/factory.js

### executeMiddlewares

The `executeMiddlewares` function in `middlewares/factory.js` serves as a pivotal utility for orchestrating the execution of a series of middleware functions. Middleware in Express.js is a fundamental concept that allows for the modularization of request handling logic, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. This function is designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous middleware seamlessly, ensuring that each middleware in the chain is executed in the correct order and any errors encountered are properly propagated.

At its core, the `executeMiddlewares` function takes an array of middleware functions and applies them to a request object (`req`), a response object (`res`), and a `next` function. The `next` function is a callback that, when called, passes control to the next middleware in the chain. If any middleware calls `next` with an argument, Express interprets that as an error and skips the remaining middleware to execute any error-handling middleware.

The function begins by iterating over the array of middleware functions. For each middleware, it checks whether the middleware is an asynchronous function. This is crucial because handling asynchronous operations in middleware can be complex due to the nature of JavaScript's event loop. If the middleware is asynchronous, the function ensures that it awaits the middleware's completion before moving on to the next middleware. This prevents issues related to race conditions and ensures that the request processing flow remains predictable.

In addition to handling asynchronous middleware, the `executeMiddlewares` function also supports middleware that returns a promise. This is particularly useful for integrating third-party libraries or custom middleware that leverage promises for asynchronous operations. By awaiting the resolution of these promises, the function ensures that all asynchronous operations are completed before proceeding to the next middleware.

Error handling is another critical aspect of the `executeMiddlewares` function. If any middleware throws an error or rejects a promise, the function catches the error and immediately calls the `next` function with the error as an argument. This triggers Express's built-in error-handling mechanism, allowing the application to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the client.

Moreover, the function supports the use of middleware arrays. This is particularly useful when a set of middleware functions needs to be applied together in a specific order. The function flattens any nested arrays of middleware, ensuring that all middleware functions are executed in the correct sequence.

In summary, the `executeMiddlewares` function in `middlewares/factory.js` is a robust utility that simplifies the execution of middleware functions in an Express.js application. By handling both synchronous and asynchronous middleware, supporting promises, and providing comprehensive error handling, it ensures a smooth and predictable request processing flow. This function is essential for building scalable and maintainable Express applications, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic rather than managing the intricacies of middleware execution.

This function is critical in ensuring that entity creation requests are thoroughly validated and processed before being committed to the database, thereby maintaining data integrity and consistency.

When invoked, this function returns a middleware function tailored to handle the creation of a specific type of entity. It takes two parameters: `entity_type`, which specifies the type of entity to be created, and an optional `save_in_database` flag that determines whether the entity should be saved in the database after processing. By default, this flag is set to `true`.

The middleware function generated by `checkAndProcessEntityCreate` follows a multi-step process to ensure that all necessary checks and operations are performed:

1. **Extract Request Attributes**: The middleware begins by extracting attributes from the incoming request. This step involves parsing the request body to retrieve the necessary data for entity creation.

2. **Validate Request Attributes**: Once the attributes are extracted, the middleware performs a series of validation checks to ensure that the provided data meets the required criteria. This includes verifying that all mandatory fields are present and that the data types and formats are correct.

3. **Check Creation Request Attributes**: In addition to basic validation, the middleware also checks for attributes specific to the creation process. This may involve additional business logic to ensure that the entity can be created under the current conditions.

4. **Process Attributes**: After validation, the middleware processes the attributes. This step may involve transforming the data, applying default values, or performing other preparatory actions necessary for entity creation.

5. **Create Entity**: If all previous steps are successful, the middleware proceeds to create the entity. This involves invoking the `createEntity` function, which handles the actual insertion of the entity into the database, provided that the `save_in_database` flag is set to `true`.

6. **Additional Processing**: The middleware allows for the insertion of additional processing steps before the entity is created. This flexibility ensures that any custom logic or side effects required by the application can be seamlessly integrated into the entity creation workflow.

The `checkAndProcessEntityCreate` function is designed to be highly modular and reusable. By encapsulating the entity creation logic within a single middleware function, it promotes code reuse and simplifies the process of adding new entity types to the back-flip project. This modularity also makes it easier to maintain and extend the functionality, as changes to the entity creation process can be made in one place and automatically applied across all relevant parts of the application.

This middleware is designed to provide a structured and secure approach to handling entity updates, allowing for additional processing steps to be inserted as needed.

When an update request is received, the middleware first validates the access rights of the requestor to ensure they have the necessary permissions to perform the update. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the data, preventing unauthorized modifications.

Once the access rights are verified, the middleware proceeds to check the attributes of the request. It ensures that the request contains all the necessary attributes required for the update and that they adhere to the defined schema for the entity. This step helps in maintaining data consistency and prevents the introduction of invalid or incomplete data into the database.

After validating the request attributes, the middleware processes them. This processing can include various operations such as transforming the data, applying business logic, or enriching the request with additional information. By allowing this level of processing, the middleware provides flexibility and extensibility, enabling developers to cater to specific requirements of their applications.

Finally, the middleware performs the actual update operation in the database. It ensures that the update is executed correctly and efficiently, adhering to the defined database schema and constraints. If the `save_in_database` flag is set to true, the middleware commits the changes to the database; otherwise, it allows for further processing or conditional saving based on additional logic.

Throughout this process, the middleware ensures that all operations are logged appropriately, providing traceability and aiding in debugging and auditing. This logging is integrated with the project's logging framework, ensuring consistency and reliability in log outputs.

By encapsulating these steps in a single middleware function, `checkAndProcessEntityUpdate` offers a robust and reusable solution for handling entity updates, promoting best practices in data validation, security, and processing. This middleware is an essential component of the `back-flip` project, contributing to the overall reliability and maintainability of the system.

### checkAndProcessEntityDelete

The `checkAndProcessEntityDelete` function within the `middlewares/factory.js` file is a crucial component for handling the deletion of entities in the back-flip project. This function serves multiple purposes, ensuring that the deletion process is both secure and efficient while maintaining data integrity and consistency across the system.

### Function Overview

The `checkAndProcessEntityDelete` function is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of an entity deletion request. It performs several key operations:

1. **Access Rights Verification**: Before any deletion occurs, the function verifies that the requesting user has the necessary permissions to delete the specified entity. This is a critical security measure to prevent unauthorized deletions and ensure that only users with the appropriate access rights can perform such operations.

2. **Pre-Deletion Processing**: The function includes mechanisms to handle any pre-deletion processing that may be required. This could involve checking for dependencies or relationships that need to be addressed before the entity can be safely deleted. For example, if the entity is referenced by other entities, those references might need to be updated or removed.

3. **Entity Deletion**: Once all checks and pre-processing steps are completed, the function proceeds with the actual deletion of the entity from the database. This step involves executing a delete operation on the database, ensuring that the entity is removed as intended.

4. **Post-Deletion Actions**: After the entity has been deleted, the function may perform additional actions such as logging the deletion event, notifying other parts of the system, or updating any related caches. These post-deletion actions help maintain system integrity and provide a clear audit trail of the deletion activity.

### Detailed Functionality

The function operates by leveraging several helper methods and utilities provided within the project. Here's a closer look at the detailed steps involved:

- **Access Rights Check**: The function first calls a utility method to check the user's access rights. This method typically involves querying the user's permissions and comparing them against the required permissions for deleting the entity. If the user does not have the necessary rights, the function will terminate and return an appropriate error response.

- **Pre-Deletion Hook**: If the access rights check passes, the function then invokes any pre-deletion hooks that may be defined. These hooks allow for custom logic to be executed before the entity is deleted. For instance, a hook might check if the entity is involved in any active transactions or if there are any pending tasks related to the entity.

- **Database Deletion Operation**: With all pre-deletion checks and hooks satisfied, the function performs the database deletion operation. This involves constructing a query to locate the entity and executing a delete command. The function ensures that the deletion is atomic and that any potential errors are handled gracefully.

- **Post-Deletion Hook**: After the entity is successfully deleted, the function calls any post-deletion hooks. These hooks can be used to perform additional cleanup tasks, such as removing related cache entries, updating search indices, or sending notifications to other services.

- **Logging and Notification**: The function also includes logging mechanisms to record the deletion event. This logging is essential for auditing purposes and helps maintain a record of all deletion activities. Additionally, the function may send notifications to other parts of the system to inform them of the deletion, ensuring that all components remain in sync.

### Error Handling

The `checkAndProcessEntityDelete` function incorporates robust error handling to manage any issues that may arise during the deletion process. If an error occurs at any stage, the function captures the error, logs it, and returns a meaningful error response to the caller. This ensures that the system can gracefully handle failures and provide clear feedback to users.

### Conclusion

In summary, the `checkAndProcessEntityDelete` function is a comprehensive and secure method for handling entity deletions within the back-flip project. By performing access rights verification, pre-deletion processing, the actual deletion operation, and post-deletion actions, the function ensures that deletions are carried out safely and efficiently. Its robust error handling and logging mechanisms further enhance the reliability and maintainability of the system.

### getAndCheckEntitiesAccess

The `getAndCheckEntitiesAccess` function is a crucial part of the middleware factory module in the "back-flip" project. This function is designed to retrieve and verify access rights for multiple entities in a single operation, ensuring that the requestor has the necessary permissions to interact with each entity. It plays a vital role in maintaining the security and integrity of the application's data by enforcing access control policies.

When a request is made that involves multiple entities, this function steps in to handle the complexity of fetching these entities and checking the requestor's access rights. It streamlines the process by combining entity retrieval and access verification into a single cohesive operation, reducing the need for repetitive code and potential errors.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the `getAndCheckEntitiesAccess` function operates:

1. **Entity Retrieval**:
   The function first identifies the entities that need to be accessed based on the request parameters. This involves extracting relevant identifiers from the request and querying the database to retrieve the corresponding entity data. The retrieval process ensures that all entities are fetched efficiently, and any necessary filtering or projection is applied to limit the data to what is strictly required for the operation.

2. **Access Verification**:
   Once the entities are retrieved, the function proceeds to verify the requestor's access rights for each entity. This involves invoking the global entity access check function, which is configured to enforce the application's access control policies. The global check ensures that the requestor has the appropriate permissions for the specified action (e.g., read, update, delete) on each entity. If the global check fails, the function then calls entity-specific access check methods if they are defined. These methods provide an additional layer of security by allowing custom access control logic tailored to individual entity types.

3. **Error Handling**:
   During the access verification process, if any access check fails, the function handles the error gracefully. It ensures that appropriate error messages are generated and returned to the client, indicating the specific reason for the denial of access. This feedback is crucial for debugging and for informing users about the access control constraints they are subject to.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   The function is optimized to handle bulk operations efficiently. By processing multiple entities in a single operation, it minimizes the overhead associated with multiple database queries and access checks. This optimization is particularly beneficial in scenarios where large sets of entities need to be accessed and verified, such as batch processing or bulk updates.

5. **Security Compliance**:
   Ensuring that access control checks are performed consistently and accurately is essential for maintaining the security of the application. The `getAndCheckEntitiesAccess` function adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that requestors can only access the data they are explicitly permitted to. This compliance with security best practices helps protect sensitive data and prevents unauthorized access.

In summary, the `getAndCheckEntitiesAccess` function is a robust and efficient solution for handling the retrieval and access verification of multiple entities within the "back-flip" project. By consolidating these operations into a single function, it simplifies the codebase, enhances performance, and strengthens the application's security posture. This function exemplifies the thoughtful design and attention to detail that underpins the middleware factory module, contributing to the overall reliability and maintainability of the project.

### getAllEntities

The `getAllEntities` function within the `middlewares/factory.js` file is designed to facilitate the retrieval of all entities of a specified type from the database. This middleware is essential for applications that need to list or display multiple records of a particular entity type, such as users, orders, or products.

When invoked, this middleware performs several key operations to ensure that the request is handled efficiently and securely:

1. **Logging**: The function begins by logging the request, including the type of entity being queried. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring purposes, providing insight into the operations being performed and any potential issues that arise.

2. **Query Construction**: The middleware constructs a query to filter the entities based on access rights. This involves calling the `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` method, which generates a query that respects the access permissions of the requestor. This step is vital for ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.

3. **Database Interaction**: With the query constructed, the middleware interacts with the database to retrieve the entities. It uses the `findEntitiesFromQuery` function from the database module, which executes the query and returns the matching entities. This function is capable of handling complex queries and can be customized based on the HTTP method used (e.g., GET requests may include additional options).

4. **Response Preparation**: Once the entities are retrieved from the database, they are stored in the `res.locals` object. This allows subsequent middleware functions or route handlers to access the entities easily. The entities are stored both in a generic list (`entity_list`) and a more specific property based on the entity handler configuration.

5. **Custom Filtering**: If the entity handler has a custom filter middleware configured, it is executed at this stage. This allows for additional processing or filtering of the entities before they are sent in the response. Custom filters can be used to apply business logic, such as excluding certain entities based on specific criteria.

6. **Sending the Response**: Finally, the middleware prepares the response to be sent back to the client. This typically involves formatting the entities into a JSON structure and setting the appropriate HTTP status code. The response is then sent, completing the request lifecycle.

The `getAllEntities` middleware is a critical component for any application that requires robust and secure access to entity data. By leveraging logging, access control, and custom filtering, it ensures that the data retrieval process is both efficient and compliant with the application's security requirements. This middleware exemplifies the modular and flexible design of the `back-flip` project, allowing developers to extend and customize its functionality to meet their specific needs.

By setting a specific target, developers can avoid hardcoding the storage location, making the middleware more flexible and adaptable to different application structures.

### Function Signature

```javascript
setUserObjectTarget: (target) => {
    self.requestor_object_target = target;
}
```

### Parameters

- `target` (string): This parameter specifies the key under which the requestor object will be stored in the `res.locals` object. For instance, if the target is set to `'user'`, the requestor information will be accessible via `res.locals.user`.

### Implementation Details

The function modifies a property within the middleware's scope, specifically `self.requestor_object_target`, to the value provided by the `target` parameter. This property is then used by other middleware functions to store and retrieve the requestor information consistently.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how `setUserObjectTarget` might be used within an Express.js middleware setup:

```javascript
const genericMiddleware = require('./middlewares/generic');

// Set the target for storing requestor information
genericMiddleware.setUserObjectTarget('user');

// Middleware to set requestor information
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const user = { id: req.user.id, name: req.user.name };
    genericMiddleware.setRequestor(res, user);
    next();
});

// Middleware to access requestor information
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const requestor = genericMiddleware.getRequestor(res);
    console.log('Requestor:', requestor);
    next();
});
```

In this example:
1. The target for storing requestor information is set to `'user'`.
2. A middleware function sets the requestor information using the `setRequestor` function.

By ensuring that the requestor's details are consistently and accurately extracted, the function helps enforce access control, logging, and auditing mechanisms.

### Implementation Details

When an HTTP request is received, the `getRequestor` middleware is invoked early in the request processing pipeline. It performs several key operations:

1. **Extraction of Authentication Tokens**:
   - The function checks for the presence of authentication tokens, such as JWT (JSON Web Token) or Bearer tokens, in the request headers. These tokens are typically used to authenticate and authorize the requestor.
   - If a JWT token is found, it is decoded to extract relevant information about the requestor, such as user ID, roles, and permissions.

2. **Validation of Tokens**:
   - The extracted tokens are validated to ensure they are not expired and are issued by a trusted source. This step is crucial for preventing unauthorized access.
   - If the tokens are invalid or missing, the function can trigger an appropriate error response, halting further processing of the request.

3. **Retrieval of Requestor Information**:
   - Upon successful validation, the function retrieves the requestor's information from the decoded token or other sources, such as session data or custom headers.
   - The retrieved information typically includes the requestor's unique identifier, roles, and any additional attributes required for access control and logging.

4. **Attaching Requestor to Request Object**:
   - The function attaches the requestor's information to the request object, making it accessible to subsequent middleware and route handlers. This enables consistent access to the requestor's details throughout the request processing pipeline.
   - By attaching the requestor's information to the request object, the function ensures that other parts of the application can easily access and utilize this information for authorization checks, logging, and custom business logic.

### Example Usage

Here is a simplified example of how the `getRequestor` function might be implemented and used within an Express.js application:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const config = require('../config');

function getRequestor(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
    if (!authHeader) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authorization header missing' });
    }

    const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1];
    jwt.verify(token, config.jwtSecret, (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
        }

        req.requestor = {
            id: decoded.id,
            roles: decoded.roles,
            permissions: decoded.permissions,
        };

        next();
    });
}

module.exports = getRequestor;
```

In this example, the `getRequestor` middleware extracts the JWT token from the request headers, verifies it using a secret key, and attaches the decoded requestor information to the request object. If the token is missing or invalid, an error response is sent back to the client.

### Benefits and Best Practices

The `getRequestor` function offers several benefits:

- **Consistency**: By centralizing the logic for extracting and validating requestor information, the function ensures a consistent approach across the application.

### setRequestor

The `setRequestor` function is a middleware utility designed to associate a requestor object with the current response object in an Express application. This is particularly useful in scenarios where subsequent middleware or request handlers need to access the requestor's information to perform operations such as authorization, logging, or data processing.

When a request is made to the server, the `setRequestor` function can be invoked to attach a requestor object, typically representing the user or system making the request, to the response object. This attachment is achieved by storing the requestor object in a specified property within the response's `locals` object, which is a convention in Express for passing data through the request-response cycle.

The function accepts two parameters: the response object (`res`) and the requestor object (`requestor`). The requestor object can contain various attributes that describe the entity making the request, such as user ID, roles, permissions, or any other relevant metadata. By storing this object in `res.locals`, it becomes accessible to any subsequent middleware or route handlers that process the same request.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the `setRequestor` function operates:

1. **Parameter Acceptance**: The function takes in the response object (`res`) and the requestor object (`requestor`). The response object is part of the standard Express.js response cycle, while the requestor object is an application-specific construct that holds information about the entity initiating the request.

2. **Locals Property**: The response object's `locals` property is used to store the requestor object. `res.locals` is a recommended way in Express to pass data between middleware and route handlers without polluting the global scope or the request object itself.

3. **Assignment**: The function assigns the requestor object to a predefined property within `res.locals`. This property is typically configured earlier in the middleware stack or within the application's initialization code. By default, it is referred to as `self.requestor_object_target` within the context of the middleware framework.

4. **Access in Subsequent Middleware**: Once the requestor object is set, it can be accessed in any subsequent middleware or route handler by referencing `res.locals[self.requestor_object_target]`. This allows for consistent and centralized access to the requestor's information, facilitating tasks such as authorization checks, audit logging, and personalized responses.

5. **Example Usage**: Consider a scenario where user authentication is performed at the beginning of the request lifecycle. Upon successful authentication, the user object is set as the requestor using the `setRequestor` function. Subsequent middleware can then use this information to enforce access controls, log user actions, or tailor responses based on the user's roles and permissions.

By utilizing the `setRequestor` function, developers can ensure that requestor information is consistently and securely propagated through the middleware stack, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the application. This approach aligns with best practices in Express.js development, promoting clean and organized code by leveraging the `locals` property for passing contextual data.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple entity types are handled within the same application, ensuring that the correct type is accessed and manipulated during various operations such as creation, update, and deletion.

When an HTTP request is received, it often contains information about the entity that needs to be processed. The `getCurrentEntityType` function extracts this information from the request, typically from the request parameters or body, and sets it within the request context for subsequent middleware and route handlers to utilize. This ensures a consistent and streamlined approach to handling entity-specific logic throughout the application.

The function operates by first examining the request object to identify the entity type. This can involve parsing URL parameters, request body fields, or even custom headers, depending on how the application is structured. Once the entity type is identified, it is stored in a predefined location within the request object, often in the `req.locals` or a similar context-specific storage. This allows other middleware functions and route handlers to easily access the entity type without needing to repeatedly parse the request.

Additionally, `getCurrentEntityType` plays a vital role in access control and validation processes. By knowing the entity type upfront, the application can enforce entity-specific access rights and validation rules. For instance, certain entity types might require higher levels of access permissions or more stringent validation checks. By setting the entity type early in the request lifecycle, these checks can be seamlessly integrated into the processing pipeline, enhancing both security and data integrity.

In terms of implementation, the function is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various application structures. It can be configured to recognize different patterns and conventions used to denote entity types within requests. This adaptability ensures that the function can be easily integrated into diverse application architectures without requiring significant modifications.

Moreover, `getCurrentEntityType` contributes to the maintainability and scalability of the codebase. By centralizing the logic for determining the entity type, it reduces redundancy and potential errors that could arise from duplicating this logic across multiple parts of the application. This centralization also makes it easier to update the logic if the method for denoting entity types in requests changes, as the update would only need to be made in one place.

To summarize, `getCurrentEntityType` is an essential middleware function that identifies and sets the type of the current entity being processed in an HTTP request. Its role in ensuring consistent entity handling, facilitating access control and validation, and enhancing code maintainability makes it a pivotal component of the middleware layer in the back-flip project.

### getCurrentEntitiesType

The `getCurrentEntitiesType` function is a crucial middleware utility designed to ascertain and retrieve the type of entities currently being handled within a request context. This middleware is particularly important in scenarios where operations need to be performed on multiple entities, and the type of those entities must be identified and processed accordingly.

This is essential for maintaining a consistent and organized flow within the application, allowing for the correct application of business logic, validation, and access control.

### Functionality

The `getCurrentEntitiesType` middleware performs the following key steps:

1. **Extraction of Entity Type**: It inspects the request object to identify the type of entities involved. This is typically done by examining specific request parameters, headers, or body fields that denote the entity type. Commonly, the entity type might be specified in the URL path, query parameters, or within the JSON payload of the request.

2. **Validation and Assignment**: Once the entity type is extracted, the middleware validates this information to ensure it corresponds to a recognized and supported entity type within the system. This step is crucial to prevent any invalid or malicious data from disrupting the application's flow. After validation, the entity type is assigned to a specific property within the request object, making it readily accessible to subsequent middleware and route handlers.

3. **Integration with Subsequent Middleware**: By setting the entity type in the request object, `getCurrentEntitiesType` facilitates seamless integration with other middleware functions. Subsequent middleware can rely on this information to perform entity-specific operations such as access control checks, CRUD operations, and response formatting.

### Example Usage

Consider an example where an API endpoint is designed to handle operations on user entities. The `getCurrentEntitiesType` middleware would extract the entity type ('user') from the request and ensure that all subsequent middleware and handlers are aware that they are dealing with user entities.

```javascript
app.use('/api/users', getCurrentEntitiesType, (req, res, next) => {
    // Middleware logic that depends on the entity type being 'user'
    if (req.entityType === 'user') {
        // Perform user-specific operations
    }
    next();
});
```

In this example, the `getCurrentEntitiesType` middleware ensures that the `req.entityType` property is set to 'user', allowing the next middleware to perform user-specific operations confidently.

### Error Handling

### getCurrentEntity

The `getCurrentEntity` function is a crucial middleware utility designed to retrieve and manage the current entity within the context of a request. This function plays a pivotal role in handling entity-specific operations, ensuring that the correct entity data is retrieved and made available for subsequent middleware or request handlers.

When a request is made that involves an entity, such as fetching details of a specific user or updating a product, the `getCurrentEntity` middleware is responsible for extracting the entity identifier from the request parameters or body. It then leverages the database utilities to fetch the corresponding entity data from the database. This retrieved entity is then stored in the response's local variables, making it accessible to other middleware functions or the final request handler.

The function begins by determining the entity type and the entity identifier. The entity type is usually inferred from the request context, while the identifier can be located in various parts of the request, such as URL parameters, query strings, or the request body. Once the identifier is located, the function logs the retrieval attempt for debugging and tracking purposes.

Subsequently, the function interacts with the database layer to fetch the entity data. This interaction typically involves calling a database utility function, such as `findEntityFromID`, which queries the database for the entity using the provided identifier. If the entity is found, it is then assigned to a local variable within the response object, allowing other middleware functions to access it seamlessly.

In cases where additional processing is required, such as applying custom filters or transforming the entity data, the `getCurrentEntity` function can invoke supplementary middleware functions. These additional middleware functions can perform tasks like filtering sensitive information, modifying the entity data structure, or validating entity attributes against predefined rules.

The `getCurrentEntity` middleware is designed to be highly modular and configurable, allowing developers to tailor its behavior according to the specific needs of their application.

This function plays a pivotal role in the context of request handling, ensuring that the entity being processed is readily accessible throughout the lifecycle of the request-response cycle.

When a request is received, various middlewares may need to interact with the entity associated with that request. The `setCurrentEntity` function facilitates this interaction by storing the entity in the `res.locals` object, a special object in Express.js that is scoped to the request. This allows subsequent middlewares and route handlers to access and manipulate the entity without needing to repeatedly query the database or perform additional processing to retrieve it.

### Functionality and Usage

The primary purpose of `setCurrentEntity` is to streamline the process of setting and retrieving the current entity being handled. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple middlewares need to operate on the same entity, such as validating input, checking permissions, or formatting data before sending a response.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how `setCurrentEntity` works:

1. **Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters:
   - `res`: The response object provided by Express.js.
   - `entity`: The entity object that needs to be set in the response's local scope.

2. **Assignment**: The function assigns the provided entity to a specific property on the `res.locals` object. This property is determined by the entity type, which is dynamically retrieved using the `getCurrentEntityType` function.

3. **Dynamic Property Setting**: By using the entity type as the key, `setCurrentEntity` ensures that the entity is stored under a meaningful and easily retrievable property name. This dynamic assignment is crucial for maintaining clarity and avoiding conflicts, especially in applications handling multiple types of entities.

4. **Subsequent Access**: Once the entity is set, it can be accessed by any subsequent middleware or route handler through the `res.locals` object. This promotes a clean and efficient flow of data, reducing redundancy and improving code maintainability.

### Example Usage

Consider a scenario where an API endpoint needs to fetch an entity from the database, validate it, and then perform some operations based on the entity's properties. The `setCurrentEntity` function can be used to store the fetched entity, making it accessible to all subsequent middleware functions.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to fetch entity from database
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const entityId = req.params.id;
    // Assume fetchEntityById is a function that fetches the entity from the database
    const entity = fetchEntityById(entityId);
    if (entity) {
        setCurrentEntity(res, entity);
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(404).send('Entity not found');
    }
});

// Middleware to validate entity
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const entity = res.locals[getCurrentEntityType(res)];
    if (validateEntity(entity)) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(400).send('Invalid entity');
    }
});

// Route handler to process entity
app.get('/entity/:id', (req, res) => {
    const entity = res.locals[getCurrentEntityType(res)];
    res.json(entity);
});

function setCurrentEntity(res, entity) {
    const entityType = getCurrentEntityType(res);
    res.locals[entityType] = entity;
}

function getCurrentEntityType(res) {
    // Logic to determine entity type
    return 'entityType';
}

function fetchEntityById(id) {
    // Mock function to simulate fetching entity from database
    return { id: id, name: 'Sample Entity' };
}

function validateEntity(entity) {
    // Mock function to validate entity
    return entity && entity.name;
}

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `setCurrentEntity` function is used to set the entity fetched from the database into the `res.locals` object. Subsequent middleware functions and the route handler can then access this entity without needing to re-fetch it, thereby streamlining the request processing pipeline.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for redundant database queries by storing the entity in the response object.
- **Clarity**: By using a dynamic property name based on the entity type, it keeps the codebase organized and easy to understand.
- **Flexibility**: Allows multiple middlewares to interact with the same entity, facilitating complex request handling scenarios.

Overall, the `setCurrentEntity` function is a crucial utility in the `middlewares/generic.js` file, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of the middleware pipeline in the back-flip project.

### getCurrentEntities

The `getCurrentEntities` function is a pivotal middleware utility designed to retrieve the current list of entities associated with a request. This function is integral for scenarios where multiple entities need to be processed or accessed simultaneously within the context of a single request.

When invoked, `getCurrentEntities` extracts the entities from the request object, ensuring that they are available for subsequent middleware functions or request handlers. This is particularly useful in applications where batch processing or handling of multiple entities is required, such as bulk updates, deletions, or complex queries.

The function operates by first validating the presence of entities in the request. If entities are found, it proceeds to retrieve and return them. This ensures that downstream middleware and handlers can operate on a consistent and expected set of entities, thus maintaining the integrity and reliability of the request processing pipeline.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the `getCurrentEntities` function:

1. **Validation**: The function begins by checking if the request object contains a property that holds the entities. This validation step is crucial to prevent errors and ensure that the function operates on a valid set of data.

2. **Retrieval**: Upon successful validation, the function retrieves the entities from the request object. This typically involves accessing a predefined property or key where the entities are stored.

3. **Return**: The retrieved entities are then returned, making them available for any subsequent middleware or request handlers that rely on this data.

The `getCurrentEntities` function is often used in conjunction with other middleware functions that set or manipulate the list of entities in the request. For example, a preceding middleware might populate the request with entities based on a database query, and `getCurrentEntities` would then be used to access these entities for further processing.

In terms of implementation, the function is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing overhead and ensuring fast access to the entities. It leverages standard JavaScript practices to interact with the request object and handle the entities.

Here’s a simplified example of how `getCurrentEntities` might be implemented:

```javascript
function getCurrentEntities(req, res, next) {
    // Check if entities are present in the request object
    if (!req.entities) {
        return res.status(400).send({ error: 'Entities not found in request' });
    }

    // Retrieve the entities
    const entities = req.entities;

    // Make entities available for subsequent middleware
    req.currentEntities = entities;

    // Proceed to the next middleware function
    next();
}
```

In this example, the function first checks for the presence of `req.entities`. If this property is not found, it responds with a 400 status code and an error message. If the entities are present, they are retrieved and assigned to `req.currentEntities`, making them accessible for downstream processing. Finally, the `next` function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

The `getCurrentEntities` function is a fundamental part of the middleware layer in the back-flip project, ensuring that entities are consistently and reliably accessed throughout the request lifecycle. Its design emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and robustness, making it a valuable tool for managing entity data in complex web applications.

### setCurrentEntities

The `setCurrentEntities` function is a pivotal middleware utility designed to manage the state and context of multiple entities within the request lifecycle. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where operations need to be performed on a collection of entities rather than a single entity. By setting the current entities, subsequent middleware and route handlers can access and manipulate this collection seamlessly.

### Purpose and Scope

The primary purpose of this function is to assign a list of entities to the request object, making them readily available for downstream middleware functions and route handlers. This is essential in workflows that involve batch processing, such as bulk updates, deletions, or validations of entities. By centralizing the assignment of entities, the function promotes a clean and organized codebase, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

### Functional Overview

The `setCurrentEntities` function takes in a list of entities and attaches it to a specific property on the request object. This property can then be accessed by any subsequent middleware or route handler, ensuring a consistent and reliable way to handle multiple entities within the same request context. The function typically performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures that the provided list of entities is valid and conforms to expected formats or schemas. This might include checking for required fields or verifying data types.
2. **Assignment**: Attaches the validated list of entities to a designated property on the request object. This property is usually named in a way that clearly indicates its purpose, such as `req.currentEntities`.
3. **Logging**: Optionally logs the operation for debugging and auditing purposes. This might include details about the number of entities set and any relevant metadata.

### Detailed Implementation

Here is a detailed look at how the `setCurrentEntities` function might be implemented:

```javascript
/**
 * Middleware to set the current entities in the request object.
 * @param {Array} entities - The list of entities to be set.
 * @returns {Function} Middleware function.
 */
function setCurrentEntities(entities) {
    return function (req, res, next) {
        // Validate the entities input
        if (!Array.isArray(entities)) {
            return next(new Error('Entities must be an array'));
        }

        // Assign the entities to the request object
        req.currentEntities = entities;

        // Log the operation
        logger.debug('setCurrentEntities', { entities });

        // Proceed to the next middleware
        next();
    };
}
```

### Usage Example

Consider a scenario where you need to update multiple user profiles in a single request. You can use the `setCurrentEntities` function to set the list of user profiles before performing the update operations:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { setCurrentEntities } = require('./middlewares/generic');

// Sample route to update multiple user profiles
app.post('/update-users', setCurrentEntities(users), (req, res) => {
    const usersToUpdate = req.currentEntities;

    // Perform update operations on usersToUpdate
    // ...

    res.status(200).send('Users updated successfully');
});
```

In this example, the `setCurrentEntities` middleware is used to attach the list of user profiles to the request object. The subsequent route handler then accesses this list via `req.currentEntities` and performs the necessary update operations.

### Error Handling

The function includes basic error handling to ensure that only valid input is processed. If the provided input is not an array, an error is passed to the next middleware in the chain, typically an error-handling middleware that sends an appropriate response to the client. This ensures that the application remains robust and can gracefully handle invalid input scenarios.

### Conclusion

The `setCurrentEntities` function is an essential middleware utility for managing collections of entities within the request lifecycle. By centralizing the assignment of entities, it simplifies the development process, promotes code reusability, and ensures a consistent approach to handling multiple entities. Whether you are performing batch updates, deletions, or validations, this function provides a reliable and efficient way to manage entity collections in your application.

### getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter

The `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` function is a crucial middleware utility in the `middlewares/generic.js` file that constructs and returns a query filter to control access to entities based on the requestor's permissions and specified criteria. This function is designed to ensure that only the entities that meet the access rights and filter conditions of the requestor are retrieved and processed.

When a request is made to retrieve multiple entities, this function dynamically generates a filter that is applied to the database query. By doing so, it enforces access control policies and respects any additional filtering criteria provided in the request. This is particularly important in applications where data privacy and security are paramount, as it prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Functionality

The `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` function performs several key operations:

1. **Extracting Query Parameters**: It begins by extracting relevant query parameters from the request object. These parameters may include filters specified by the requestor, such as fields to include or exclude in the response.

2. **Determining Default Access Rights**: The function then determines the default access rights for the requestor based on their role and permissions. This involves loading the allowed properties for entity retrieval, which are predefined in the entity model.

3. **Constructing the Filter**: Using the extracted query parameters and the default access rights, the function constructs a filter object. This filter object specifies the criteria that entities must meet to be included in the response. It includes conditions for properties that should be included (`only`) or excluded (`without`), ensuring that the response is tailored to the requestor's permissions and needs.

4. **Combining Filters**: If both inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided, the function combines them to form a comprehensive filter. This ensures that only the entities that meet all specified conditions are retrieved from the database.

5. **Returning the Filter**: Finally, the function returns the constructed filter object, which is then used in subsequent database queries to retrieve the appropriate entities.

### Example Usage

Consider a scenario where an API endpoint is designed to retrieve all entities of a specific type, but only those that the requestor has permission to access. The `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` function would be used as follows:

```javascript
const filter = getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter(req, res);
const entities = await db.findEntitiesFromQuery(entity_type, filter, req.method === 'GET' ? options : undefined);
res.locals[entity_handler.entities] = entities;
```

In this example, the function is called to generate the filter based on the request and response objects. The generated filter is then applied to the database query to retrieve the entities. The retrieved entities are stored in the response's local variables for further processing.

### Benefits

The `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` function offers several benefits:

- **Security**: By enforcing access control policies, it ensures that only authorized entities are retrieved, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Flexibility**: The function accommodates various query parameters, allowing requestors to specify inclusion and exclusion criteria tailored to their needs.
- **Reusability**: As a middleware utility, it can be reused across multiple endpoints and routes, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.

In summary, the `getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter` function is an essential component of the `middlewares/generic.js` file, providing robust access control and filtering capabilities for retrieving entities. By dynamically generating query filters based on requestor permissions and specified criteria, it ensures secure and tailored data retrieval, making it a valuable tool in the back-flip project's middleware arsenal.

### setEntityAccessQueryFilter

The `setEntityAccessQueryFilter` function is a critical component within the `middlewares/generic.js` file, designed to manage and customize the access control mechanisms for entities within the Back-Flip project. This function allows developers to define a custom query filter that will be applied to all entity access operations, ensuring that only authorized entities are accessible based on specific criteria.

### Function Signature

```javascript
setEntityAccessQueryFilter: (fn) => {
    self.getAllEntitiesAccessQueryFilter = fn;
}
```

### Parameters

- **fn**: A function that defines the custom query filter logic. This function is expected to return a query object that will be used to filter entities based on access rights.

### Usage

The `setEntityAccessQueryFilter` function is utilized to override the default access query filter mechanism. By providing a custom function, developers can tailor the access control logic to meet the specific requirements of their application. This is particularly useful in scenarios where entity access needs to be restricted based on complex business rules or user permissions.

### Example

Consider a scenario where access to entities needs to be restricted based on the user's role and department. The custom query filter function can be defined as follows:

```javascript
const customAccessQueryFilter = (req, res) => {
    const user = req.user;
    if (user.role === 'admin') {
        return {}; // Admins have access to all entities
    } else {
        return { department: user.department }; // Restrict access to entities within the user's department
    }
};

setEntityAccessQueryFilter(customAccessQueryFilter);
```

In this example, the `customAccessQueryFilter` function checks the user's role and department. If the user is an admin, the function returns an empty query object, granting access to all entities. For non-admin users, the function returns a query object that restricts access to entities within the user's department.

### Integration with Middleware

The custom query filter set by `setEntityAccessQueryFilter` is integrated into the middleware functions that handle entity access. When an entity access operation is performed, the custom query filter is invoked to generate the appropriate query object, ensuring that only authorized entities are retrieved.

For instance, in the `filterEntityAccess` middleware function, the custom query filter is applied as follows:

```javascript
filterEntityAccess: async (req, res) => {
    log.debug("GenericMiddleware - filterEntityAccess");
    const requestor = self.getRequestor(res),
        filter = res.locals.filter;
    if (typeof filter === 'function') {
        if (!(await filter(entity, requestor))) {
            throw new AccessDeniedError();
    } else if (!utils.entityMatchQuery(entity, filter)) {
        throw new AccessDeniedError();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `filter` variable, which holds the custom query filter function, is used to determine if the entity matches the access criteria. If the entity does not meet the criteria, an `AccessDeniedError` is thrown, preventing unauthorized access.

### Benefits

The ability to set a custom entity access query filter provides several benefits:

1. **Flexibility**: Developers can define complex access control logic tailored to their application's requirements.
2. **Security**: By restricting access to entities based on specific criteria, the risk of unauthorized data access is minimized.
3. **Maintainability**: Centralizing the access control logic in a single function makes it easier to manage and update as requirements change.

### Conclusion

The `setEntityAccessQueryFilter` function is a powerful tool for managing entity access control within the Back-Flip project. By allowing developers to define custom query filters, it provides the flexibility needed to implement robust and secure access control mechanisms. This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that entity access is governed by the specific business rules and security requirements of the application.

### success

The `success` function in the `middlewares/generic.js` file plays a crucial role in handling successful HTTP responses within the back-flip project. This middleware function is designed to streamline the process of sending standardized success responses to the client, ensuring consistency and clarity in the API's communication.

When implementing RESTful APIs, it is essential to provide clear and consistent responses to client requests. The `success` function achieves this by encapsulating the logic for formatting and sending success responses. This not only reduces redundancy across the codebase but also makes it easier to maintain and update response formats as needed.

### Functionality

The `success` function is typically invoked after a request has been processed successfully, such as after creating, updating, or retrieving an entity from the database. It takes care of constructing the response object and sending it back to the client with the appropriate HTTP status code.

### Parameters

The `success` function accepts the following parameters:

1. **req**: The Express request object, which contains information about the HTTP request, including parameters, body data, and headers.
2. **res**: The Express response object, which is used to send the response back to the client.
3. **data**: An optional parameter that contains the data to be included in the response body. This could be an entity, a list of entities, or any other relevant information.
4. **message**: An optional parameter that provides a custom message to be included in the response. This can be useful for providing additional context or information to the client.
5. **statusCode**: An optional parameter that specifies the HTTP status code for the response. If not provided, the function defaults to using the 200 OK status code.

### Implementation

The `success` function begins by constructing a response object. This object typically includes the following properties:

- **status**: A string indicating the success of the operation, usually set to "success".
- **message**: A message providing additional information about the operation. If a custom message is provided as a parameter, it is used; otherwise, a default message is generated based on the operation.
- **data**: The data to be included in the response body. This could be an entity, a list of entities, or any other relevant information. If no data is provided, this property may be omitted or set to null.

Once the response object is constructed, the `success` function sends it back to the client using the Express `res.json()` method. If a custom status code is provided, it is used; otherwise, the function defaults to the 200 OK status code.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how the `success` function might be used in a route handler:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { success } = require('./middlewares/generic');

// Example route handler for creating an entity
router.post('/entities', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const newEntity = await createEntity(req.body);
    success(req, res, newEntity, 'Entity created successfully', 201);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});

// Example route handler for retrieving an entity
router.get('/entities/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const entity = await findEntityById(req.params.id);
    if (!entity) {
      return res.status(404).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Entity not found' });
    }
    success(req, res, entity, 'Entity retrieved successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this example, the `success` function is used to send a standardized success response to the client after successfully creating or retrieving an entity. By using this middleware function, the code is cleaner, more maintainable, and consistent across different route handlers.

### Benefits

Using the `success` function provides several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that all success responses follow a standardized format, making it easier for clients to parse and understand the responses.
2. **Maintainability**: Centralizes the logic for constructing success responses, making it easier to update the response format or add new properties as needed.
3. **Clarity**: Simplifies route handlers by removing the need to manually construct and send success responses, allowing developers to focus on the core logic of the request processing.
4. **Reusability**: Promotes code reuse by providing a generic function that can be used across different parts of the application.

In conclusion, the `success` function in the `middlewares/generic.js` file is a vital component of the back-flip project, ensuring that successful HTTP responses are handled in a consistent, maintainable, and clear manner. By encapsulating the logic for constructing and sending success responses, this middleware function simplifies the codebase and enhances the overall quality of the API.

### checkRequestAccessRight

The `checkRequestAccessRight` function is a middleware designed to enforce access control based on the requestor's permissions. This function is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the application by ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions on the entities within the system.

When a request is received, the middleware first logs a debug message to indicate the initiation of the access rights check. This logging is facilitated by the `winston` logger, configured in the logging module, providing a detailed trace for debugging and monitoring purposes.

The function then retrieves the permissions associated with the requestor. This is achieved through the `getRequestPermissions` method provided by the `EntityHandler`. The permissions define the scope of actions that the requestor is allowed to perform, such as reading, creating, updating, or deleting entities.

Once the permissions are obtained, the middleware verifies if the requestor has the necessary permissions to proceed with the requested operation. This verification process involves consulting the `EntityModel`, which contains the logic for assessing whether the requestor’s permissions meet the required criteria for the operation. If the requestor lacks the required permissions, an `AccessDeniedError` is thrown, effectively halting the request and returning an appropriate error response to the client.

Additionally, the middleware supports special access conditions. In scenarios where an `AccessDeniedError` is encountered, but the request includes a special access handler (`specialAccessAllowMdv`), this handler is invoked to determine if the request can be granted under specific conditions. This feature provides flexibility for handling exceptional cases where standard permissions may not suffice.

Overall, the `checkRequestAccessRight` middleware is a robust mechanism for enforcing access control within the back-flip project. By leveraging the `EntityHandler` for permissions retrieval and the `EntityModel` for permissions validation, it ensures that all operations are performed by authorized users, thereby upholding the security and integrity of the application. The integration of special access conditions further enhances its adaptability, making it a vital component in the middleware suite of the project.

### checkEntityAccessRight

The `checkEntityAccessRight` function is a crucial middleware component designed to ensure that the requestor has the necessary permissions to access a specific entity. This function plays a pivotal role in maintaining the security and integrity of the application by verifying that only authorized users can perform operations on entities.

When a request is received, the `checkEntityAccessRight` middleware is invoked to perform a series of checks. It begins by logging the initiation of the access check process, which aids in debugging and monitoring access control activities. The middleware then proceeds to retrieve the requestor's information, which typically includes user credentials and roles, from the response object. This information is essential for determining the permissions associated with the requestor.

Next, the middleware identifies the type of entity being accessed. This is achieved by extracting the entity type from the response object, which may involve parsing the request URL or examining request parameters. Once the entity type is determined, the middleware retrieves the specific entity instance that the requestor intends to access. This is done by querying the database or an in-memory store to fetch the entity based on identifiers provided in the request.

With the requestor's information and the entity details at hand, the middleware calls the `entityAccessCheck` function from the model. This function is responsible for performing the actual access control logic. It checks whether the requestor has the required permissions to perform the requested operation (e.g., read, write, delete) on the entity. The access control logic may involve evaluating the requestor's roles, examining entity-specific access control lists, and applying business rules defined within the application.

If the `entityAccessCheck` function determines that the requestor lacks the necessary permissions, it throws an `AccessDeniedError`. This error signifies that the requestor is not authorized to access the entity, and the middleware responds accordingly by denying the request and sending an appropriate error message to the client.

In some cases, the middleware may encounter special conditions that allow for exceptions to the standard access control rules. For instance, certain requests may have a `specialAccessAllowMdv` function defined, which provides additional logic to grant access under specific circumstances. If such a function is present and the initial access check fails, the middleware invokes this function to determine if access can be granted based on the special conditions.

Overall, the `checkEntityAccessRight` middleware ensures that all entity access requests are thoroughly vetted against the application's access control policies. By enforcing strict access controls, this middleware helps protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the application's operations. It is a vital component in the security architecture of the back-flip project, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with entities in the system.

### checkEntitiesAccessRight

The `checkEntitiesAccessRight` function is a crucial middleware component designed to ensure that access rights are properly enforced across multiple entities within a request. This function iterates through a list of entities, verifying that the requestor has the necessary permissions to access each one. It leverages other middleware functions, such as `checkEntityAccessRight`, to perform individual entity checks, ensuring a comprehensive and consistent access control mechanism.

When a request is made that involves multiple entities, the `checkEntitiesAccessRight` middleware is invoked to handle the access validation process. The function begins by retrieving the list of entities from the `res.locals.entity_list` property, which is expected to be populated by previous middleware or request handling logic. This list contains the entities that the requestor intends to access or manipulate.

For each entity in the list, the middleware sets the current entity type and entity in the response locals object, making them accessible to subsequent middleware functions. It then calls the `checkEntityAccessRight` function to perform the actual access validation for the current entity. This nested call ensures that each entity undergoes the same rigorous access checks, leveraging the existing logic and permissions framework.

The `checkEntityAccessRight` function, which is invoked for each entity, checks the requestor's permissions against the required permissions for the entity type and the specific entity. If the requestor lacks the necessary permissions, an `AccessDeniedError` is thrown, effectively halting the request processing and returning an appropriate error response to the client. This ensures that unauthorized access attempts are promptly blocked, maintaining the security and integrity of the system.

In addition to checking access rights, the `checkEntitiesAccessRight` middleware also handles any special access conditions that may be defined for the request. For example, if the request includes a `specialAccessAllowMdv` function, this function is called to determine if special access can be granted under certain conditions. This allows for flexibility in handling edge cases or exceptional scenarios where standard access rules might need to be overridden.

Overall, the `checkEntitiesAccessRight` middleware plays a vital role in enforcing access control policies across multiple entities within a request. By iterating through the entity list and leveraging the `checkEntityAccessRight` function, it ensures that each entity is subject to the same stringent access checks, providing a robust and consistent security mechanism for the application.

### getRequestAttributes

The `getRequestAttributes` function is a middleware designed to extract and filter request body attributes based on the access rights of the requestor. This middleware plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized data is processed and passed along the request lifecycle, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the application.

When an HTTP request is received, it often contains a payload in its body, especially for POST, PUT, and PATCH methods. The `getRequestAttributes` middleware inspects this payload and filters it according to the access rights defined for the current entity and the requestor. This process involves several steps:

1. **Logging and Initialization**:
   The middleware begins by logging a debug message to indicate that it has been invoked. This logging is useful for tracing and debugging purposes. The target body of the request is then determined. If the `entity_handler` specifies a `body_target`, the middleware will use that specific part of the request body; otherwise, it defaults to the entire request body.

2. **Filtering Based on Access Rights**:
   The core functionality of this middleware is to filter the request body attributes. This is achieved by calling the `getFilteredObjectFromAccessRights` function from the model, passing in the entity, the request body, the requestor, and the HTTP method. This function evaluates the access rights and returns a filtered object, which includes the authorized data and a list of removed attributes that the requestor is not permitted to access.

3. **Handling Unauthorized Parameters**:
   If the `entity_handler` is configured to reject unauthorized parameters (`reject_on_unauthorized_parameter`), the middleware checks if any attributes were removed during the filtering process. If there are unauthorized parameters, it throws an `AccessDeniedError`, effectively blocking the request from proceeding further. This step is critical for enforcing strict access control policies.

4. **Storing Filtered Data**:
   The filtered data is then stored in `res.locals.body_data`. This allows subsequent middleware and route handlers to access the sanitized and authorized data without needing to reprocess the request body. By using `res.locals`, the middleware ensures that the filtered data is scoped to the current request and does not interfere with other requests being handled by the server.

5. **Error Handling and Next Middleware**:
   As with any middleware, error handling is an essential aspect. If any errors occur during the processing, they are caught and handled appropriately. If no errors are encountered, the middleware calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the stack.

In summary, the `getRequestAttributes` middleware is a vital component for managing request data securely and efficiently. By filtering request body attributes based on access rights, it ensures that only authorized data is processed, thereby protecting sensitive information and enforcing access control policies. This middleware enhances the robustness and security of the application, making it a critical part of the request handling pipeline.

### checkCreationRequestAttributes

The `checkCreationRequestAttributes` function is a critical middleware component designed to ensure that the attributes within the request body adhere to the specified model before an entity is created. This middleware function performs thorough validation checks to guarantee that all required attributes are present and meet the necessary criteria, thus preventing the creation of incomplete or invalid entities within the database.

When a client sends a request to create a new entity, this middleware intercepts the request and examines the attributes provided in the request body. The primary objective is to validate these attributes against the model's requirements, which are predefined and associated with the entity handler. The entity handler contains a list of mandatory attributes that must be present for the creation process to proceed successfully.

Upon receiving the request, the middleware retrieves the list of required attributes from the entity handler. This list specifies which attributes are essential for the creation of the entity. The middleware then iterates over each attribute in this list to verify its presence in the request body. If an attribute is missing, the middleware raises an error, specifically a `MissingModelAttributeError`, indicating that a required attribute is absent.

In scenarios where attributes are conditionally required, meaning that at least one attribute from a group must be present, the middleware handles this by splitting the group into individual attributes and checking for the existence of at least one of them. If none of the attributes in the group are present, the middleware throws an error, ensuring that the request adheres to the model's conditional requirements.

Additionally, the middleware is equipped to handle complex validation logic. For instance, it can check for nested attributes within the request body, ensuring that the structure of the data conforms to the expected schema. This level of validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing the insertion of malformed data into the database.

The middleware also supports the rejection of unauthorized parameters. If the entity handler is configured to reject unauthorized parameters, the middleware filters the request body to remove any attributes that are not allowed. If any unauthorized attributes are found and the configuration mandates rejection, the middleware raises an `AccessDeniedError`.

In summary, the `checkCreationRequestAttributes` middleware plays a vital role in the entity creation process by performing comprehensive validation checks on the request body. It ensures that all required attributes are present and valid, adheres to conditional attribute requirements, handles nested attributes, and enforces authorization rules. By doing so, it maintains the integrity and consistency of the data within the database, preventing the creation of entities with incomplete or invalid data.

### checkRequestAttributes

The `checkRequestAttributes` function serves as a middleware that ensures the attributes present in the request body adhere to the specified model's requirements. This middleware is critical for maintaining data integrity and validation within the application, preventing invalid or incomplete data from being processed.

When a request is received, this middleware is invoked to scrutinize the request body against the predefined schema of the entity it pertains to. It operates by leveraging the entity handler's `verifyAgainstModel` method to perform this validation. This method is responsible for ensuring that all required attributes are present and that they conform to the expected data types and constraints defined within the model.

The middleware begins by logging the initiation of the attribute checking process, providing a clear trace in the log files for debugging and monitoring purposes. It then retrieves the current entity handler from the response object, which contains the necessary model and validation logic. This handler is crucial as it encapsulates the specific rules and requirements for the entity being processed.

Next, the middleware extracts the data from the request body. This data is then passed to the `verifyAgainstModel` method of the entity handler. The `verifyAgainstModel` method performs a thorough validation, checking each attribute against the model's schema. If any attribute is missing, of the wrong type, or does not meet the specified constraints, the method throws an error.

If the validation is successful, the middleware proceeds without interruption, allowing the request to continue to the next middleware or route handler. However, if the validation fails, an error is thrown, and the middleware halts the request processing. This error is typically caught by an error-handling middleware, which then sends an appropriate response to the client, indicating the nature of the validation error. This ensures that clients are informed of any issues with their request data, allowing them to correct and resend their requests.

The `checkRequestAttributes` middleware is an essential component of the back-flip project's request processing pipeline. It ensures that only valid and well-formed data is processed, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the application's data. By enforcing strict adherence to the entity models, it helps prevent data corruption and ensures that the application operates smoothly and predictably.

In summary, this middleware plays a pivotal role in the data validation process by:

1. Logging the initiation of the attribute checking process for traceability.
2. Retrieving the current entity handler from the response object.
3. Extracting data from the request body.
4. Validating the data against the entity's model using the `verifyAgainstModel` method.
5. Halting the request processing and throwing an error if validation fails.
6. Allowing the request to proceed if validation is successful.

This robust validation mechanism is crucial for maintaining the application's data integrity and providing a reliable and predictable service to its users.

### processAttributes

The `processAttributes` function is a crucial middleware component designed to handle the processing of attributes within an entity. This middleware plays a vital role in ensuring that entity attributes are correctly processed according to the defined business logic before any further operations are performed. 

When a request is received, the `processAttributes` middleware is invoked to manage any attribute-specific processing that might be necessary. This can include tasks such as validation, transformation, or enrichment of the attributes within the request body. The middleware ensures that the entity attributes conform to the expected schema and meet the required criteria before proceeding with the request.

Here's how the `processAttributes` function operates:

1. **Logging and Debugging**: The function begins by logging a debug message indicating that the attribute processing is about to commence. This is useful for tracking the flow of the request and diagnosing issues during development and debugging.

2. **Entity Handler Retrieval**: The middleware retrieves the current entity handler from the response object. The entity handler is responsible for managing entity-specific operations and contains the logic for processing attributes. This retrieval ensures that the correct entity context is used for the subsequent operations.

3. **Attribute Processing Middleware Execution**: If the entity handler has an attribute processing middleware defined (`attributesProcessingMdw`), the `processAttributes` function will invoke this middleware. The attribute processing middleware is a custom function that performs specific operations on the entity attributes, such as validation, transformation, or enrichment. By executing this middleware, the `processAttributes` function ensures that the attributes are processed according to the custom logic defined for the entity.

4. **Asynchronous Execution**: The `processAttributes` function is designed to handle asynchronous operations. This is particularly important when attribute processing involves asynchronous tasks, such as fetching additional data from a database or an external API. The function uses `await` to ensure that all asynchronous operations are completed before proceeding with the request.

5. **Error Handling**: If any errors occur during the attribute processing, they are caught and handled appropriately. This ensures that any issues with the attributes are identified and reported, preventing invalid data from being processed further.

The `processAttributes` middleware is a flexible and powerful component that allows for the customization of attribute processing logic for different entities. By leveraging this middleware, developers can ensure that entity attributes are processed consistently and according to the specific requirements of the application.

In summary, the `processAttributes` function is an essential middleware that handles the processing of entity attributes in a request. It retrieves the appropriate entity handler, executes any custom attribute processing middleware, and ensures that all operations are completed asynchronously. This middleware plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and consistency of entity data within the application.

### send

The `send` function is a crucial utility within the `middlewares/generic.js` file, designed to streamline the process of sending HTTP responses in the back-flip project. This function ensures that responses are formatted consistently and dispatched efficiently, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the middleware layer.

Primarily, the `send` function is invoked after the middleware has processed a request and is ready to return a response to the client. It abstracts the intricacies involved in crafting an HTTP response, making it easier for developers to focus on the core logic of their middleware without worrying about the nuances of response handling.

The `send` function accepts several parameters that allow it to customize the response based on the context of the request and the outcome of the middleware processing. These parameters typically include the response object (`res`), the status code (`statusCode`), and the response payload (`data`). By encapsulating these parameters, the function ensures that all responses adhere to a standardized structure, which is critical for maintaining consistency across the API.

One of the key features of the `send` function is its ability to handle different types of response payloads. Whether the payload is a simple success message, a complex JSON object, or an error message, the function formats it appropriately before sending it back to the client. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where the middleware needs to return various types of data based on different conditions or outcomes.

Additionally, the `send` function integrates seamlessly with the project's logging mechanisms. It logs pertinent information about the response, such as the status code and payload, which aids in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior. This logging capability is essential for maintaining transparency and traceability, especially in complex systems where understanding the flow of data is critical.

The function also incorporates error handling to ensure that any issues encountered during the response sending process are managed gracefully. For instance, if an unexpected error occurs while formatting the response payload, the function can catch and log the error, then send a generic error response to the client. This proactive error management helps to maintain the stability and reliability of the API, even in the face of unforeseen issues.

In summary, the `send` function in `middlewares/generic.js` is a vital component of the back-flip project's middleware layer. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP responses, ensures consistency in response formatting, integrates with the logging system for better traceability, and incorporates robust error handling. By leveraging this function, developers can enhance the efficiency and reliability of their middleware, ultimately contributing to a more stable and maintainable API.

### clearBodyData

The `clearBodyData` function is a middleware utility specifically designed to sanitize and remove any residual data from the `res.locals.body_data` object within an Express request lifecycle. This function plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the request handling process by ensuring that any sensitive or unnecessary information stored in `res.locals.body_data` is cleared out before the request completes or transitions to the next middleware.

When a request is processed by an Express application, various pieces of information may be temporarily stored in the `res.locals` object, which is a recommended place to store request-specific data during the lifecycle of a request. The `res.locals.body_data` property, in particular, can be used to hold body data that might be manipulated or utilized by different middleware functions throughout the request processing pipeline.

The `clearBodyData` function is typically invoked towards the end of the middleware chain, ensuring that all necessary operations on the `res.locals.body_data` have been completed. By calling this function, any data that was stored in `res.locals.body_data` is deleted, thereby preventing any potential data leakage or unintended data persistence across different requests. This is especially important in scenarios where sensitive information might be handled, ensuring that such data does not inadvertently persist in memory beyond the scope of the request.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the `clearBodyData` function operates:

1. **Invocation**: The function is called as part of the middleware chain in an Express route handler. It does not take any arguments and operates directly on the `res.locals` object.

2. **Data Clearance**: The core functionality of the `clearBodyData` function is to delete the `res.locals.body_data` property. This is achieved using the `delete` operator in JavaScript, which removes the specified property from the object.

3. **Middleware Continuation**: After clearing the `res.locals.body_data`, the function calls the `next` function, which is a standard practice in Express middleware to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. This ensures that the request processing continues seamlessly.

By incorporating the `clearBodyData` function into the middleware pipeline, developers can ensure a higher degree of control over the request lifecycle, specifically in terms of data management. This function helps in mitigating risks associated with data retention and enhances the overall security posture of the application.

In summary, the `clearBodyData` middleware function is a vital component for managing and sanitizing request-specific data in an Express application. Its primary purpose is to ensure that any temporary data stored in `res.locals.body_data` is appropriately cleared out, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing unintended data persistence across requests. This function is an essential tool for developers aiming to build secure and efficient Express applications.

## middlewares/responses.js

### requestSuccess

The `requestSuccess` function is a middleware component designed to handle successful HTTP responses in the back-flip project. This utility plays a crucial role in standardizing the way success responses are formatted and sent back to the client, ensuring consistency and clarity across the entire application.

When an HTTP request is processed by the server, it often goes through multiple middleware functions that handle various aspects of the request, such as authentication, validation, and business logic execution. Once these processes are completed successfully, the `requestSuccess` middleware is invoked to finalize the response. This middleware is typically placed towards the end of the middleware chain, just before the response is sent back to the client.

The primary function of `requestSuccess` is to construct a well-formed HTTP response that communicates the success of the request. It does this by setting the appropriate status code and including any relevant data in the response body. The structure of the response is designed to be easily understandable and useful for the client application, which may need to process the response data further.

Here is a breakdown of what the `requestSuccess` middleware does:

1. **Status Code Setting**: The middleware sets a standard HTTP status code to indicate a successful operation. Typically, this would be a 200 OK status code, but it can be customized based on the specific requirements of the request. For example, a 201 Created status code might be used for successful creation operations.

2. **Response Body Construction**: The middleware constructs the response body, which usually includes a success message and any data that needs to be returned to the client. This data could be the result of a database query, an object representing a newly created entity, or any other relevant information.

3. **JSON Formatting**: To ensure compatibility with most client applications, the response body is formatted as a JSON object. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for both humans and machines.

4. **Logging**: Optionally, the middleware can also log the successful response. This is useful for monitoring and debugging purposes, as it provides a record of successful operations that can be reviewed later.

5. **Error Handling**: Although the primary purpose of this middleware is to handle successful responses, it also includes basic error handling to ensure that any issues encountered during the response construction are appropriately managed. This prevents the server from crashing and ensures that the client receives a meaningful response even in the case of unexpected errors.

The following is an example of how the `requestSuccess` middleware might be used in an Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Other middleware and route handlers...

// Success response middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.requestSuccess = (data) => {
        res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            data: data
        });
    };
    next();
});

// Example route that uses the requestSuccess middleware
app.get('/api/example', (req, res) => {
    // Perform some operations...
    const result = { message: 'Operation successful', value: 42 };
    
    // Send the success response
    res.requestSuccess(result);
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).json({
        success: false,
        message: err.message
    });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `requestSuccess` middleware is added to the Express application. It defines a `requestSuccess` method on the response object, which can be called to send a standardized success response. The `/api/example` route handler demonstrates how to use this middleware to send a success response with some example data.

By using the `requestSuccess` middleware, developers can ensure that all successful responses in the back-flip project are consistent and follow a standardized format. This not only improves the readability and maintainability of the code but also enhances the overall developer experience by providing a clear and predictable way to handle successful HTTP responses.

### catchHttpErrors

The `catchHttpErrors` middleware function is a crucial component in the error-handling mechanism of the back-flip project. This function is designed to intercept and handle HTTP errors that occur during the processing of requests, ensuring that errors are consistently formatted and appropriately communicated back to the client.

When an error is thrown within the application, the `catchHttpErrors` middleware captures it and processes it based on its type and attributes. This middleware is typically placed towards the end of the middleware stack, just before the uncaught error handler, to ensure that it can catch errors propagated by other middleware functions or route handlers.

The function works by first checking if the error object is an instance of the `HttpError` class or any of its subclasses, such as `BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError`, `ForbiddenError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `TooManyRequestsError`, `InternalServerError`, or `ServiceNotAvailableError`. These custom error classes are defined in the `model/errors.js` file and encapsulate specific HTTP status codes and messages.

Upon capturing an error, the middleware extracts relevant information such as the status code, error message, and any additional JSON data that might have been included with the error. This information is then used to construct a standardized error response. The response typically includes the HTTP status code, a descriptive error message, and any supplementary data that can help the client understand the nature of the error.

For instance, if a `NotFoundError` is thrown because a requested resource could not be found, the `catchHttpErrors` middleware will create a response with a 404 status code and a message indicating that the resource was not found. Similarly, if a `BadRequestError` is encountered due to invalid input data, the middleware will respond with a 400 status code and a message detailing the validation errors.

In addition to handling known HTTP errors, the middleware is also capable of dealing with unexpected or generic errors. If the error is not an instance of the predefined HTTP error classes, the middleware defaults to treating it as an internal server error. In such cases, it logs the error details for debugging purposes and sends a 500 status code response to the client, indicating that an unexpected error occurred on the server.

The consistent handling of errors by the `catchHttpErrors` middleware ensures that clients receive clear and uniform error responses, regardless of where the error originated in the application. This not only improves the client experience by providing meaningful feedback but also aids in debugging and maintaining the application by standardizing error logging and response structures.

Overall, the `catchHttpErrors` middleware is an essential part of the back-flip project's error-handling strategy, providing robust and consistent error management across the entire application.

### uncaughtError

The `uncaughtError` function in the `middlewares/responses.js` file is designed to handle unexpected errors that occur during the processing of HTTP requests. This middleware function acts as a global error handler, ensuring that any unhandled exceptions are caught and properly managed, thus preventing the application from crashing and providing a consistent user experience.

When an unhandled exception is thrown within the application, the `uncaughtError` middleware intercepts it, logs the error details for debugging purposes, and sends a standardized error response to the client. This response typically includes an appropriate HTTP status code and a message indicating that an internal server error has occurred.

The primary responsibilities of the `uncaughtError` function are as follows:

1. **Error Logging**: The function logs detailed information about the error, including the stack trace, to help developers diagnose and fix the issue. This logging is done using the configured logging mechanism, which in this project is likely the `winston` logger configured in `log/index.js`.

2. **Response Formatting**: It formats the error response in a consistent manner, ensuring that clients receive a clear and understandable message. The response usually contains an HTTP status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) and a generic error message to avoid exposing sensitive information about the server's internals.

3. **Maintaining Application Stability**: By catching and handling uncaught errors, this middleware ensures that the application remains stable and continues to function, even when unexpected errors occur. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and availability of the service.

Here is a high-level overview of how the `uncaughtError` function operates within the middleware chain:

- **Invocation**: The middleware is placed at the end of the middleware chain in an Express application. This ensures that it catches any errors that were not handled by previous middleware or route handlers.
- **Error Handling**: When an error is passed to this middleware, it performs the logging and response formatting tasks mentioned above.
- **Sending Response**: Finally, it sends the formatted error response back to the client, completing the error handling process.

In summary, the `uncaughtError` middleware is a critical component for robust error management in the back-flip project. It enhances the application's resilience by capturing unhandled exceptions, logging them for further investigation, and providing a consistent error response to clients. This middleware not only helps in maintaining the stability of the application but also aids developers in identifying and resolving issues effectively.

## model/EntityHandler.js

### loadRequestEntity

The `loadRequestEntity` function is a middleware designed to enhance the request handling process by associating the current request with an instance of the `EntityHandler` class. This function plays a crucial role in the middleware chain, ensuring that subsequent middleware and route handlers have access to the entity-specific operations and configurations encapsulated within the `EntityHandler`.

When invoked, the `loadRequestEntity` function performs the following steps:

1. **Associating EntityHandler with the Request**: The function assigns the current instance of `EntityHandler` to the `res.locals.entity_handler` property. This association allows other middleware and route handlers downstream in the request lifecycle to easily access the entity handler, facilitating operations such as entity validation, permission checks, and attribute processing.

2. **Proceeding to the Next Middleware**: After setting the `EntityHandler` instance, the function checks if a `next` callback is provided and if it is a function. If both conditions are met, the `next` function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the Express.js application's request-response cycle. This ensures that the request continues to be processed without interruption.

By integrating `loadRequestEntity` into the middleware stack, developers can streamline the handling of entity-related logic within their Express.js applications. The function simplifies the process of making the `EntityHandler` available throughout the request lifecycle, thereby promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.

In summary, `loadRequestEntity` is a middleware function that enhances request processing by linking the current request with an `EntityHandler` instance, thereby enabling seamless access to entity-specific operations and configurations for subsequent middleware and route handlers. This function is essential for maintaining a clean and efficient flow of request handling, particularly in applications that heavily rely on entity management and processing.

### getModel

The `getModel` function within the `EntityHandler` class is an essential component designed to facilitate the retrieval of the model associated with a specific entity. This function plays a crucial role in managing and interacting with the entity's schema, ensuring that the structure and constraints defined for the entity are consistently enforced throughout the application.

When invoked, `getModel` returns the model object that encapsulates the schema of the entity. This schema typically includes definitions for various attributes of the entity, such as data types, validation rules, and any nested structures. By providing a centralized and standardized way to access the model, `getModel` helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the data.

### Key Features and Usage

1. **Retrieving the Model Schema**:
   The primary function of `getModel` is to return the model schema associated with the entity. This schema is a deep copy of the original model, ensuring that any modifications to the returned object do not affect the original schema. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the schema needs to be inspected or manipulated temporarily without altering the base definition.

2. **Ensuring Data Integrity**:
   By consistently using the model schema returned by `getModel`, the application can enforce data integrity rules defined within the schema. This includes type validations, required fields, and custom validation logic. The function ensures that all operations on the entity adhere to the predefined rules, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.

3. **Supporting Nested Structures**:
   The model schema can include nested structures, allowing for complex entity definitions. `getModel` handles these nested structures seamlessly, providing a comprehensive view of the entity's schema, including any sub-models or embedded documents. This is particularly useful for applications dealing with hierarchical or relational data.

4. **Integration with Middleware**:
   The `getModel` function is often used in conjunction with various middleware functions within the application. For example, middleware responsible for validating incoming requests, processing entity attributes, or checking access rights can leverage the model schema to perform their tasks accurately. By providing a reliable way to access the model, `getModel` enhances the overall robustness of the middleware layer.

5. **Customization and Extensibility**:
   The model schema returned by `getModel` can be customized and extended to meet specific application requirements. Developers can define custom validation rules, transformation logic, and other schema-related configurations. This flexibility ensures that the schema can evolve alongside the application, accommodating new features and changes in business logic.

### Example Usage

Consider a scenario where an entity represents a user profile with attributes such as `name`, `email`, and `address`. The `getModel` function would return a schema object defining these attributes, including their data types and validation rules. Middleware responsible for processing user profile updates can use this schema to validate incoming data, ensuring that only valid and well-formed profiles are persisted in the database.

```javascript
const userProfileHandler = new EntityHandler(userProfileModel);
const userProfileSchema = userProfileHandler.getModel();

// Example schema structure
/*
{
  name: { type: 'string', required: true },
  email: { type: 'string', required: true, format: 'email' },
  address: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      street: { type: 'string' },
      city: { type: 'string' },
      zip: { type: 'string' }
    }
  }
}
*/

// Middleware using the schema for validation
app.post('/updateProfile', (req, res) => {
  const { error } = validate(req.body, userProfileSchema);
  if (error) {
    return res.status(400).send(error.details);
  }
  // Proceed with updating the user profile
});
```

In summary, the `getModel` function is a vital part of the `EntityHandler` class, providing a robust mechanism for retrieving and working with entity schemas. It ensures data integrity, supports complex nested structures, integrates seamlessly with middleware, and offers customization and extensibility to adapt to evolving application needs. By leveraging `getModel`, developers can build reliable and maintainable applications that adhere to strict data validation and consistency standards.

### getRequestPermissions

The `getRequestPermissions` function is a critical component within the `EntityHandler` class, designed to manage and verify the permissions associated with various entities. This function is responsible for determining the access rights of a requestor to perform specific actions on an entity. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring that only authorized users can perform operations like creating, reading, updating, or deleting entities.

When a request is made to interact with an entity, the `getRequestPermissions` function is invoked to check the permissions of the requestor. This involves evaluating the permissions set against the requestor's credentials and the required permissions for the operation. The function typically takes the requestor's details, the entity type, and the action to be performed as input parameters.

The process starts by retrieving the requestor's permissions, which could involve querying a database or an external service. These permissions are then compared against the permissions required for the specific action on the entity. The required permissions are often defined in the entity's schema or configuration files, ensuring that the access control policies are consistent and centralized.

If the requestor has the necessary permissions, the function returns a positive response, allowing the operation to proceed. If the requestor lacks the required permissions, the function throws an appropriate error, preventing unauthorized access. This mechanism ensures robust security and compliance with access control policies.

Additionally, the `getRequestPermissions` function can be customized to include more complex logic, such as checking for conditional permissions based on the entity's state or the requestor's role within the organization. This flexibility allows the function to adapt to various security requirements and organizational policies.

In summary, the `getRequestPermissions` function is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the entity management system. By verifying the requestor's permissions before allowing any operation, it ensures that only authorized users can access or modify entities, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance with access control policies.

### setEntityAccessCheckFn

The function `setEntityAccessCheckFn` is designed to define a custom access check function for entities managed by the `EntityHandler` class. This function allows developers to inject specific logic to determine if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain operations on an entity.

When invoked, `setEntityAccessCheckFn` accepts a single argument, which is a function that will be used to check access rights. This custom function should follow a specific signature to ensure compatibility with the `EntityHandler`'s internal mechanisms. The custom function typically takes parameters such as the requestor's information, the type of entity, the specific entity in question, and the HTTP method being requested. The function is expected to return a promise that resolves if the access is granted or rejects with an appropriate error if access is denied.

Using `setEntityAccessCheckFn`, developers can tailor the access control logic to meet the specific needs of their application. For instance, it can incorporate complex business rules, interact with external authorization services, or apply dynamic policies based on user roles, entity states, or other contextual information.

Here is an example of how `setEntityAccessCheckFn` might be utilized within an application:

```javascript
const entityHandler = new EntityHandler();

// Define a custom access check function
const customAccessCheck = async (requestor, entityType, entity, method) => {
  // Perform custom access logic
  if (requestor.role === 'admin') {
    return; // Admins have full access
  }
  
  if (method === 'GET' && entity.isPublic) {
    return; // Allow public access for read operations
  }
  
  if (requestor.id === entity.ownerId) {
    return; // Owners can access their own entities
  }
  
  // If none of the conditions are met, deny access
  throw new AccessDeniedError(`Access denied for ${method} on ${entityType}`);
};

// Set the custom access check function
entityHandler.setEntityAccessCheckFn(customAccessCheck);
```

In this example, the custom access check function grants full access to administrators, allows public read access for entities marked as public, and permits owners to access their own entities. If none of these conditions are met, an `AccessDeniedError` is thrown, indicating that the access is denied.

By leveraging `setEntityAccessCheckFn`, developers gain fine-grained control over entity access policies, enabling them to enforce security requirements and ensure that only authorized users can interact with sensitive data. This flexibility is crucial for building robust applications that adhere to stringent security standards and provide a seamless user experience.

### setAttributesProcessingMdw

This middleware function is expected to perform specific processing tasks on the attributes of an entity, enabling tailored handling that can include validation, transformation, enrichment, or any other custom logic needed before the entity is persisted or further processed.

### Usage

The primary use case for `setAttributesProcessingMdw` is to ensure that entity attributes conform to certain criteria or undergo necessary transformations before they are acted upon. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where entity attributes need to be sanitized, enriched with additional data, or validated against complex business rules.

### Parameters

- **mdw (Function)**: This is the middleware function that will be assigned for processing the entity attributes. The middleware function typically accepts three parameters: `req`, `res`, and `next`.
  - **req (Object)**: The request object, which may contain the entity data in its body or other properties.
  - **res (Object)**: The response object, which can be used to send responses back to the client.
  - **next (Function)**: A callback function that should be called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack. If an error occurs, `next` should be called with an error object.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use `setAttributesProcessingMdw` within an `EntityHandler` instance:

```javascript
const entityHandler = new EntityHandler(someEntityModel);

// Define a custom middleware function for processing attributes
const customAttributeProcessor = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.body && req.body.attributes) {
        // Example processing: Convert all attribute names to lowercase
        req.body.attributes = Object.keys(req.body.attributes).reduce((acc, key) => {
            acc[key.toLowerCase()] = req.body.attributes[key];
            return acc;
        }, {});
    }
    next();
};

// Assign the custom middleware to the EntityHandler instance
entityHandler.setAttributesProcessingMdw(customAttributeProcessor);
```

In this example, the custom middleware function processes the entity attributes by converting all attribute names to lowercase before passing control to the next middleware. This kind of processing can help standardize attribute names, ensuring consistency across the application.

### Benefits

The ability to set custom attribute processing middleware provides several benefits:

1. **Customization**: Developers can define specific processing rules that align with their business logic and application requirements.
2. **Reusability**: Middleware functions can be reused across different entities or operations, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating attribute processing logic in middleware, the core entity handling code remains clean and focused on its primary responsibilities.
4. **Flexibility**: Middleware can be easily swapped or updated without modifying the core `EntityHandler` implementation, allowing for agile development and quick adjustments to changing requirements.

### Conclusion

The `setAttributesProcessingMdw` function is a powerful feature of the `EntityHandler` class, enabling developers to inject custom processing logic into the entity handling workflow. By leveraging this function, the back-flip project ensures that entity attributes can be meticulously processed according to specific needs, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the application.

### setAttributesFormattingMdw

The `setAttributesFormattingMdw` function is a crucial part of the `EntityHandler` class, designed to enhance the flexibility and modularity of attribute formatting within the back-flip project. This function allows developers to define custom middleware specifically for formatting entity attributes before they are processed or stored. By enabling the dynamic assignment of formatting middleware, it ensures that the handling of entity attributes can be tailored to meet various application requirements and data integrity standards.

When invoked, `setAttributesFormattingMdw` accepts a middleware function as its parameter. This middleware function is responsible for transforming or validating the attributes of an entity according to the application's business logic. The middleware can perform a variety of tasks, such as normalizing data formats, enforcing attribute constraints, or applying complex transformations to ensure that the attributes adhere to specific rules or standards before they are further processed.

The flexibility provided by `setAttributesFormattingMdw` is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different entities or requests might require distinct formatting rules. For instance, one entity might need date attributes to be converted into a standardized format, while another might require the sanitization of string inputs to prevent injection attacks. By leveraging this function, developers can easily plug in the appropriate middleware to handle these diverse requirements without modifying the core logic of the application.

To use `setAttributesFormattingMdw`, developers need to define a middleware function that takes the entity attributes as input and returns the formatted attributes. This function is then passed to `setAttributesFormattingMdw`, which assigns it to the `attributesFormattingMdw` property of the `EntityHandler` instance. The assigned middleware function will be executed at the appropriate stage in the entity processing pipeline, ensuring that all attributes are correctly formatted before any further operations are performed.

Here is an example of how to define and set an attribute formatting middleware:

```javascript
const entityHandler = new EntityHandler(model);

// Define a middleware function for formatting attributes
const formatAttributes = (attributes) => {
    // Example: Convert all string attributes to lowercase
    for (let key in attributes) {
        if (typeof attributes[key] === 'string') {
            attributes[key] = attributes[key].toLowerCase();
        }
    }
    return attributes;
};

// Set the formatting middleware using setAttributesFormattingMdw
entityHandler.setAttributesFormattingMdw(formatAttributes);
```

In this example, the `formatAttributes` function converts all string attributes of an entity to lowercase. This function is then assigned as the formatting middleware using `setAttributesFormattingMdw`. As a result, whenever the entity's attributes are processed, they will be automatically converted to lowercase, ensuring consistency and adherence to the desired formatting rules.

Overall, `setAttributesFormattingMdw` is a powerful feature that promotes clean and maintainable code by decoupling attribute formatting logic from the core entity handling processes. It empowers developers to implement and manage attribute formatting rules in a modular and reusable manner, contributing to the robustness and adaptability of the back-flip project.

This integration allows for a high degree of customization, as the middleware can access and manipulate request data, headers, query parameters, and more.

A typical use case for setting a custom filter middleware might involve scenarios where entities need to be filtered based on dynamic criteria that cannot be predefined in static middleware. For instance, if an application needs to apply different validation rules based on the user's role or the entity's state, a custom middleware function can be crafted to handle these conditions dynamically.

Here is an example demonstrating the usage of `setCustomFilterMdw`:

```javascript
const customFilterMiddleware = async (req, res) => {
    const { entity } = res.locals;
    const userRole = req.user.role;

    // Apply custom filtering logic based on user role
    if (userRole === 'admin') {
        // Allow access to all attributes for admin users
        return;
    } else {
        // Filter out sensitive attributes for non-admin users
        entity.attributes = entity.attributes.filter(attr => !attr.sensitive);
    }
};

// Assuming entityHandler is an instance of EntityHandler
entityHandler.setCustomFilterMdw(customFilterMiddleware);
```

In this example, the custom middleware checks the user's role and filters out sensitive attributes from the entity if the user is not an admin. This approach ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

By utilizing `setCustomFilterMdw`, developers can create robust and adaptable middleware functions that cater to complex application requirements. This method significantly enhances the modularity and maintainability of the codebase, as custom filtering logic can be encapsulated within dedicated middleware functions, promoting reuse and separation of concerns.

Its ability to return a deep clone of the model ensures that the integrity of the original schema is preserved, thereby supporting a wide range of operations that depend on accurate and consistent schema representations.

### getModelClone

The `getModelClone` function is a crucial method within the `EntityModel` class that allows for the duplication of the entity model. This function is designed to create a deep copy of the model, ensuring that any modifications made to the cloned model do not affect the original model. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to be extended, modified, or used as a basis for creating submodels without altering the original schema.

When `getModelClone` is invoked, it takes an optional parameter `as_submodel`. If this parameter is set to `true`, the function will remove the `_model_root` property from the cloned model. This is essential for cases where the cloned model is intended to be used as part of a larger model structure, thereby preventing the cloned model from being treated as a root model.

The process of cloning the model involves utilizing the `_.cloneDeep` function from the `lodash` library. This ensures that all nested properties and objects within the model are recursively duplicated, resulting in a completely independent copy. The deep cloning capability is vital for maintaining the integrity and isolation of the model instances, especially in complex applications where multiple model manipulations occur simultaneously.

Here is a breakdown of the `getModelClone` method's functionality:

1. **Initialization**: The function begins by creating a deep copy of the current model using `_.cloneDeep(this.model)`. This step ensures that a new, independent instance of the model is created.

2. **Submodel Handling**: If the `as_submodel` parameter is provided and set to `true`, the `_model_root` property is deleted from the cloned model. This step is crucial for integrating the cloned model into a larger model hierarchy without it being recognized as a root model.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the cloned model, which can then be used independently of the original model.

The `getModelClone` method is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to be reused or extended. For example, when creating a new entity type that shares a subset of properties with an existing model, `getModelClone` can be used to create a base model that can be further customized without affecting the original model.

The function accepts a single parameter, `target`, which represents the path to the desired property within the model. The path is specified as a string, with each level of the hierarchy separated by a dot (e.g., "parent.child.grandchild"). This hierarchical approach enables the function to navigate through complex, deeply nested models.

Upon invocation, the method splits the `target` string into an array of individual keys, representing each level in the hierarchy. It then iteratively traverses the model using these keys. Starting from the root of the model, it accesses each subsequent level based on the current key in the hierarchy. If at any point a key does not exist within the current level of the model, the function returns `null`, indicating that the specified target path is invalid or does not exist.

One of the notable aspects of this method is its handling of models marked with the `_model_root` property. This special property indicates the root level of the model. When navigating through the model, the function checks whether the current level is the root. If it is, it directly accesses the next level using the current key. Otherwise, it attempts to access the next level through a default property path, such as 'properties.each_prop' or 'properties.' concatenated with the current key. This approach ensures that the function can handle both root and nested levels appropriately, providing robust and flexible target retrieval capabilities.

The `getModelTarget` method is essential for scenarios where dynamic access to model properties is required. For example, in applications involving dynamic forms, data validation, or conditional logic based on specific model properties, this method provides a reliable way to retrieve the necessary data points. By abstracting the complexity of navigating through nested models, it simplifies the process of working with intricate data structures, enhancing the overall efficiency and maintainability of the codebase.

In summary, the `getModelTarget` function within the `EntityModel` class offers a powerful mechanism for retrieving specific targets from a model.

When a disconnection event occurs in the NATS messaging system, it is crucial to handle it effectively to ensure the robustness and reliability of the `back-flip` project. The `handleDisconnect` function is designed to manage such scenarios efficiently. This function is triggered when the NATS client detects a disconnection, and it performs several critical tasks to maintain the system's stability.

First, the function logs the disconnection event using the `winston` logger, providing detailed information about the disconnection, which is essential for debugging and monitoring purposes. The log entries include the nature of the disconnection and any associated error messages, helping developers trace and resolve issues promptly.

Next, the function sets the `connected` flag to `false`, indicating that the client is no longer connected to the NATS server. This flag is used throughout the application to check the connection status and to prevent operations that require an active connection when the client is disconnected.

The `handleDisconnect` function also includes a mechanism to attempt reconnection. It waits for a predefined period, specified by the `RECONNECT_WAIT_TIME` constant, before attempting to reconnect to the NATS server. This wait time helps to avoid overwhelming the server with immediate reconnection attempts and provides a buffer period for the server to recover if it was temporarily unavailable.

Additionally, the function utilizes a utility function, `utils.wait`, to implement the wait period. This utility function ensures that the reconnection attempts are spaced out appropriately, adhering to the specified wait time. After the wait period, the function calls the `connect` method to re-establish the connection to the NATS server. If the reconnection is successful, the `connected` flag is set to `true`, and normal operations can resume.

In scenarios where the disconnection is due to a manual intervention, such as a planned maintenance or a deliberate shutdown, the function logs this event separately. This distinction helps in understanding the context of the disconnection and in differentiating between unexpected disconnections and planned ones.

Overall, the `handleDisconnect` function is a critical component in ensuring the resilience of the `back-flip` project's messaging system. By effectively managing disconnections and implementing a robust reconnection strategy, it helps maintain continuous communication with the NATS server, thereby supporting the application's reliability and uptime.

When invoked, the function begins by checking if a connection already exists. If a connection is already established, the function returns immediately, preventing unnecessary reconnection attempts. This check is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding redundant operations.

If no existing connection is found, the function proceeds to establish a new connection using the NATS client library. It does this by creating a new instance of the NATS client and configuring it with the necessary connection parameters, such as the server URL, authentication credentials, and connection options. These options typically include settings for connection timeouts, maximum reconnection attempts, and intervals between reconnection attempts.

The function then attempts to connect to the NATS server. During this process, it handles various connection events to ensure robust operation. For instance, it listens for events such as 'connect', 'disconnect', 'reconnect', 'error', and 'close'. Each of these events triggers specific handlers that manage the connection state and perform necessary actions. For example, the 'connect' event handler may log a successful connection message, while the 'reconnect' event handler might log a reconnection attempt and update internal state variables.

Error handling is a critical aspect of this function. If an error occurs during the connection attempt, the function captures the error and logs it using the project's logging mechanism. Depending on the nature of the error, the function may also trigger a retry mechanism, attempting to reconnect to the NATS server after a specified delay. This retry mechanism is essential for ensuring that temporary network issues or server outages do not permanently disrupt the messaging system.

Additionally, the function is designed to be asynchronous, allowing it to perform non-blocking operations. This design choice ensures that the function can handle connection attempts and reconnections without blocking the main execution thread of the application. As a result, the application remains responsive and can continue processing other tasks while the connection is being established or re-established.

Once a successful connection is established, the function updates internal state variables to reflect the new connection status. It may also perform additional setup tasks, such as initializing message streams or subscribing to specific topics. These tasks ensure that the messaging system is fully operational and ready to handle incoming and outgoing messages.

In summary, this function is a robust, asynchronous mechanism for establishing and maintaining a connection to the NATS server.

This is managed through an internal state tracking mechanism that flags streams as initialized once the setup process is complete.

The function then proceeds to create a deep clone of the default stream configuration, ensuring that any modifications to the configuration are isolated and do not affect the default settings. The cloned configuration is then customized with the provided stream name and subjects. If additional options are supplied, they are merged into the cloned configuration, allowing for flexible and dynamic stream setups.

Following the configuration setup, `initializeStream` attempts to add the stream to the JetStream Management (JSM) API. This step is critical as it registers the stream with the NATS server, making it available for message operations. If the stream already exists but with a different configuration, the function updates the existing stream to match the new configuration. This ensures that any changes in the stream setup are reflected without disrupting the existing stream infrastructure.

Throughout the process, the function handles exceptions gracefully. For instance, if an error occurs because the stream name is already in use with a different configuration, the function updates the stream configuration and rethrows the error. This approach ensures that the stream setup is always consistent with the desired configuration, even in the face of conflicts.

Upon successful initialization, the function logs the event, providing valuable insights into the stream setup process. This logging is facilitated by the `winston` logger, which is configured to include contextual information such as the stream name. This level of detail in logging aids in troubleshooting and monitoring the stream infrastructure.

The function also maintains a list of initialized streams, which is used to track and manage the streams throughout their lifecycle. This list is essential for operations like purging streams, where the function needs to iterate over all initialized streams to perform cleanup tasks.

In summary, the `initializeStream` function is a robust and flexible solution for setting up message streams in a NATS-based messaging system. It ensures that streams are correctly configured, handles conflicts gracefully, and provides detailed logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.

This function is responsible for maintaining a loop that processes incoming messages, ensuring that each message is appropriately handled and acknowledged.

When `loopConsumer` is invoked, it first retrieves the consumer instance for the specified queue. This is achieved by calling the `consume` method on the consumer instance, which returns an asynchronous iterator of messages. The function then enters a loop, iterating over each message received from the queue.

For each message, `loopConsumer` decodes the message data using the `sc.decode` method to convert it from its encoded format into a usable JavaScript object. This decoded data is then passed to a user-defined consumer function, which processes the message according to the application's specific requirements. The consumer function is expected to handle the business logic associated with the message, such as updating a database, triggering an event, or performing other operations.

Once the message has been successfully processed by the consumer function, the message is acknowledged using the `m.ack` method. Acknowledging the message informs the NATS server that the message has been successfully handled and can be removed from the queue.

In the event that an error occurs during the processing of a message, the `loopConsumer` function catches the exception and logs an error message using the `logger.error` method. The error log includes details about the error to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting. After logging the error, the function calls the `m.nak` method to negatively acknowledge the message. This action informs the NATS server that the message could not be processed successfully and should be retried or moved to a dead-letter queue, depending on the server's configuration.

The `loopConsumer` function is designed to run indefinitely, continuously consuming and processing messages from the queue. This design ensures that the application can handle a steady stream of incoming messages without interruption. The function's use of asynchronous iteration and error handling mechanisms makes it robust and capable of managing high-throughput message processing scenarios.

- `entity_name`: This parameter specifies the name of the entity to be queried. It is essential for identifying the correct collection within the database.
- `query`: A JavaScript object representing the query criteria. This object defines the conditions that the entities must meet to be retrieved.
- `cb`: A callback function that handles the result of the query. This function is invoked with two arguments: an error (if any) and the retrieved entity.
- `options`: An optional parameter that allows for additional configurations. These configurations include:
  - `only`: An array specifying which attributes of the entity should be included in the result.
  - `without`: An array specifying which attributes of the entity should be excluded from the result.

The `findEntityFromQuery` function begins by logging the inputs using the `logger.debug` method, providing visibility into the function's operations. It then constructs a projection object based on the `options` parameter. The projection determines which fields of the entity are included or excluded in the query result.

The core of the function involves executing the query against the specified collection. The `collection.findOne` method is used to retrieve a single entity that matches the query criteria. The result of this query is then passed to the callback function.

In case of an error during the query execution, the function constructs a `DatabaseError` object, providing context about the error and the operation that caused it. This error is then passed to the callback function.

The `findEntityFromQuery` function is designed to be asynchronous, leveraging `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous operations. This design ensures that the function can be integrated seamlessly into modern JavaScript codebases, which often rely on asynchronous patterns.

Overall, the `findEntityFromQuery` function is a powerful tool for retrieving specific entities from the database based on flexible query criteria. Its design accommodates various configurations, making it adaptable to different testing scenarios and requirements.

### setConsumeAction

The `setConsumeAction` method is a crucial function within the `PubTestClient` class, designed to control the behavior of message consumption during testing scenarios. This method allows developers to simulate different message handling actions, thereby enabling a more comprehensive and flexible testing process.

When utilizing the `setConsumeAction` method, you can specify two parameters: `action` and `wait_time`. The `action` parameter determines the type of action that will be executed when a message is consumed. The method supports several predefined actions, including 'throw' and 'wait'. 

- **Action: 'throw'**: This action is used to simulate an error scenario. When set, the message consumer will throw an error upon message consumption. This is particularly useful for testing the robustness and error-handling capabilities of your system.
  
- **Action: 'wait'**: This action introduces a delay in message processing. By specifying the `wait_time` parameter (in milliseconds), you can simulate scenarios where message processing is delayed. This helps in testing the system's behavior under conditions of high latency or slow processing.

The `wait_time` parameter is optional and defaults to 1000 milliseconds if not provided. This parameter is only relevant when the `action` is set to 'wait', and it defines the duration for which the system should wait before completing the message consumption process.

By leveraging the `setConsumeAction` method, developers can create a variety of test cases that mimic real-world scenarios, ensuring that the system can handle different types of message consumption behaviors effectively. This method is particularly beneficial for stress testing and for validating the system's response to various edge cases.

In summary, the `setConsumeAction` method in the `PubTestClient` class is a powerful tool for controlling message consumption behavior during testing. By allowing developers to specify actions and wait times, it provides a flexible mechanism to simulate different message handling scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the system.

### clearReceivedMessages

The `clearReceivedMessages` function is a crucial utility within the `PubTestClient` class, designed to manage and streamline the testing process for message publishing and consumption in the back-flip project. This function plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the message queue state is reset between tests, thereby maintaining the integrity and isolation of each test case.

When invoked, `clearReceivedMessages` effectively resets the internal storage of received messages within the `PubTestClient` instance. This internal storage is represented by the `received_messages` object, which holds all messages received by the client, categorized by their respective keys. By clearing this object, the function ensures that any previously received messages do not interfere with subsequent tests, allowing for accurate and reliable test results.

The primary use case for `clearReceivedMessages` is within the setup or teardown phases of test suites. By integrating this function into the test lifecycle, developers can guarantee that each test starts with a clean slate, free from residual data that could potentially skew results. This is particularly important in scenarios where multiple tests are run in succession, and the state of the message queue must be meticulously controlled to avoid cross-contamination of test data.

To illustrate its usage, consider a typical test scenario where the `PubTestClient` is utilized to verify the correct functioning of a message publishing system. Before each test, `clearReceivedMessages` is called to purge any lingering messages from previous tests. This ensures that the test environment is pristine and that any messages received during the test can be attributed solely to the actions performed within that specific test case.

Here is a code example demonstrating the integration of `clearReceivedMessages` within a test suite:

```javascript
const { PubTestClient } = require('./path/to/pub_test_client');
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Message Publishing Tests', () => {
    let pubClient;

    beforeEach(() => {
        pubClient = new PubTestClient();
        pubClient.clearReceivedMessages(); // Clear messages before each test
    });

    it('should publish a message successfully', async () => {
        // Simulate message publishing
        await pubClient.publish('test.message', { data: 'example' });

        // Retrieve received messages
        const messages = pubClient.getReceivedMessages('test.message');
        
        // Assert that the message was received
        assert.strictEqual(messages.length, 1);
        assert.deepStrictEqual(messages[0], { data: 'example' });
    });

    // Additional tests...
});
```

In this example, `clearReceivedMessages` is called in the `beforeEach` hook, ensuring that the message queue is cleared before each test runs. This practice helps maintain test isolation and reliability, which are critical for robust software testing.

Moreover, the `clearReceivedMessages` function is designed to be straightforward and efficient, minimizing the overhead associated with resetting the message queue state. By providing a simple method to clear received messages, the `PubTestClient` class enhances the developer's ability to write clean, maintainable, and accurate tests for message-based systems.

In summary, `clearReceivedMessages` is an indispensable function within the `PubTestClient` class, essential for maintaining the integrity of message queue tests. Its ability to reset the internal message storage ensures that each test is conducted in a controlled environment, free from the influence of previous test data. This function exemplifies the importance of state management in testing and underscores the commitment to reliable and precise software development practices in the back-flip project.

### getReceivedMessages

The `getReceivedMessages` function is a crucial utility within the `PubTestClient` class designed to facilitate the retrieval of messages that have been received by the client during testing. It plays a pivotal role in validating the behavior of the messaging system by allowing developers to inspect and verify the messages that have been consumed.

When invoked, this function can operate in two distinct modes depending on whether a specific message key is provided as an argument. If a key is specified, the function will return an array of messages associated with that particular key. This is particularly useful for scenarios where messages are categorized or tagged with unique identifiers, enabling precise and targeted message retrieval. For instance, in a system where different types of events are published to a message queue, each event type might be associated with a unique key. By passing the key corresponding to a specific event type to the `getReceivedMessages` function, one can obtain all messages related to that event, facilitating detailed inspection and validation.

In the absence of a key argument, the function defaults to returning all received messages, organized in a dictionary-like structure where each key corresponds to an event type or message category, and the associated value is an array of messages for that category. This mode is beneficial for comprehensive testing and debugging, as it provides a holistic view of all messages that have been received by the client, regardless of their type or category. It enables testers to quickly identify any unexpected or erroneous messages that might have been consumed, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and resolution of issues within the messaging system.

The messages returned by `getReceivedMessages` are stored in the `received_messages` attribute of the `PubTestClient` instance. This attribute is a dictionary where the keys are message identifiers and the values are arrays of messages. The structure of the messages themselves is defined by the messaging system in use, and they typically contain pertinent information such as the event type, payload, and metadata.

In practice, the `getReceivedMessages` function is often used in conjunction with other testing utilities provided by the `PubTestClient` class, such as `setConsumeAction` and `clearReceivedMessages`. For example, after setting a specific consume action and performing a series of operations that result in message publishing, a tester might call `getReceivedMessages` to verify that the expected messages were received and processed correctly. Following this, the `clearReceivedMessages` function can be used to reset the message state, ensuring a clean slate for subsequent tests.

In summary, the `getReceivedMessages` function is an indispensable tool for developers and testers working with the `back-flip` project. It provides a flexible and efficient means of accessing received messages, whether for specific keys or in their entirety, thereby enabling thorough validation and debugging of the messaging system.

## test_utils/requests.js

### setBaseUrl

The `setBaseUrl` function is an essential utility for configuring the base URL for HTTP requests in the testing environment of the back-flip project. This function allows you to dynamically set the root endpoint for all subsequent HTTP requests made using the `requests.js` module, ensuring that the tests are pointed towards the correct server or service endpoint.

The function takes a single parameter, `url`, which is a string representing the base URL that will be used for all HTTP requests. By default, the base URL is set to `http://localhost:3000`, but this can be modified to point to different environments such as staging, production, or any other server instance used during testing.

Here is a breakdown of the `setBaseUrl` function:

1. **Parameter**:
   - `url` (String): The base URL to be set for HTTP requests. This should include the protocol (e.g., `http` or `https`) and the domain or IP address, along with the port number if applicable.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function assigns the provided `url` to the `base_url` property of the `requests.js` module. This property is then used as the root endpoint for constructing full URLs for HTTP requests.
   - This dynamic configuration is particularly useful in testing scenarios where the target server may change frequently, such as switching between local development servers, CI/CD pipelines, or cloud-based test environments.

3. **Usage**:
   - Before making any HTTP requests in your test scripts, call the `setBaseUrl` function with the desired URL. This ensures that all subsequent requests are directed to the correct server.
   - Example usage:
     ```javascript
     const requests = require('./requests');

     // Set the base URL to a different server
     requests.setBaseUrl('http://staging-server:3000');

     // Now all requests will use the new base URL
     requests.makeRequest('/api/v1/resource', { method: 'get' }, { status_code: 200 });
     ```

4. **Benefits**:
   - **Flexibility**: Allows tests to be easily reconfigured to point to different environments without changing the core logic of the test cases.
   - **Maintainability**: Centralizes the configuration of the base URL, making it easier to update and manage.
   - **Consistency**: Ensures that all HTTP requests in the test suite are consistently directed to the intended endpoint, reducing the risk of test failures due to incorrect URLs.

In summary, the `setBaseUrl` function is a crucial tool for managing and configuring the endpoint for HTTP requests in the back-flip project's testing framework. By allowing dynamic setting of the base URL, it provides flexibility and maintainability, ensuring that tests can be easily adapted to different environments.

### makeRequest

The `makeRequest` function is a versatile utility designed to facilitate the process of making HTTP requests during testing. It leverages the `axios` library to perform a wide range of HTTP operations and includes built-in mechanisms to verify responses against expected outcomes, making it an indispensable tool for integration and unit tests.

### Parameters and Options

The `makeRequest` function accepts three primary parameters:

1. **url**: A string representing the endpoint to which the request will be made. This can be a relative or absolute URL, depending on the context of the tests.
2. **options**: An object containing various configurations for the request. This includes:
   - **method**: Specifies the HTTP method to be used (e.g., 'get', 'post', 'put', 'delete'). Defaults to 'get' if not provided.
   - **data**: An object containing the payload to be sent with the request, applicable for methods like 'post' and 'put'.
   - **headers**: An object representing any custom headers that need to be included in the request. This can be used to set authorization tokens, content types, etc.
   - **jwt_token**: A string representing a JWT token for authorization. If provided, it will be added to the headers as 'Authorization: jwt <token>'.
   - **bearer_token**: Similar to `jwt_token`, but added as 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'.
   - **log_res**: A boolean flag indicating whether the response should be logged to the console. Useful for debugging.
3. **expect**: An object defining the expected outcomes of the request. This includes:
   - **status_code**: The HTTP status code expected in the response. Defaults to 200.
   - **body**: An optional object or value that the response body is expected to match.
   - **min_duration**: An optional integer specifying the minimum duration (in milliseconds) the request should take. This is useful for performance testing.

### Function Workflow

The function initiates by capturing the current timestamp to measure the duration of the request. It then configures the headers based on the provided options, adding authorization tokens if present. Using `axios`, the function performs the HTTP request to the specified URL with the given method, data, and headers.

Upon receiving the response, the function verifies the status code against the expected value. If the status code does not match, an assertion error is thrown, indicating the discrepancy. If the `log_res` flag is set, the response is logged to the console for further inspection.

Additionally, the function checks the duration of the request. If a minimum duration is specified, it asserts that the elapsed time meets or exceeds this value. This ensures that the request performance aligns with the expected criteria.

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `makeRequest` function in a test scenario:

```javascript
const { makeRequest } = require('./test_utils/requests');

describe('API Integration Tests', () => {
    it('should create a new entity successfully', async () => {
        const url = '/api/entities';
        const options = {
            method: 'post',
            data: { name: 'Test Entity' },
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            jwt_token: 'your-jwt-token'
        };
        const expect = {
            status_code: 201,
            body: { success: true, entity: { name: 'Test Entity' } }
        };

        await makeRequest(url, options, expect);
    });

    it('should return a list of entities', async () => {
        const url = '/api/entities';
        const options = {
            method: 'get',
            headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
        };
        const expect = {
            status_code: 200,
            body: { entities: [{ name: 'Test Entity' }] }
        };

        await makeRequest(url, options, expect);
    });
});
```

In this example, two test cases are defined. The first test case verifies that a new entity can be created successfully, expecting a 201 status code and a specific response body. The second test case checks that a list of entities can be retrieved, expecting a 200 status code and a predefined list of entities in the response body.

### Error Handling

The `makeRequest` function includes robust error handling mechanisms. If the request fails or the response does not meet the expected criteria, the function throws an assertion error, providing detailed information about the failure. This ensures that any issues are promptly identified and can be addressed during the testing phase.

By using the `makeRequest` function, developers can streamline the process of making and verifying HTTP requests, ensuring that their API endpoints behave as expected under various conditions. This utility is a critical component of the `back-flip` project's testing suite, contributing to the overall reliability and robustness of the application.
